<H1>JNIPort Players</H1>
<P>
These two sections introduce the main players in the community of JNIPort objects and
try to explain something of how they interact.
</P>
<P>
This presentation is about the <EM>objects</EM>, which is in contrast to the
<A href="layers.html">alternative</A> presentation as a breakdown into the three
<EM>layers</EM> of the software.
Here I mostly ignore anything below layer two, since it's only used in the implementation of
these concepts.  I also ignore the distinction between layers two and three; the topmost
layer just provides ways of automating what layer two does without materially changing the
cast of objects.
</P>
<P>
Another approach to understanding the basic concepts of JNIPort is 
<A href="java-base.html">this</A> overview of the classes involved.
</P>
<!-- UPDATEME -->
<P>
<strong>Please note:</strong> <em>this description has become slightly out of date.  It is still
accurate as far as it goes, but it should be updated to discuss the JVM's role as a
<code class="Smalltalk">&lt;javaClassFinder&gt;</code>, and how the new &ldquo;supplementary
classloaders&rdquo; fit into the picture.  The section on the class lifecycle should be
updated to mention the additional possibility of being converted into a &ldquo;lazy
ghost&rdquo;.</em>
</P>
<H2><A name="JVM">The JVM Object</A></H2>
<P>
The central actor in JNIPort is the is the <DFN>JVM</DFN> object, an instance of class
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JVM</CODE> (or a subclass).  This represents one running Java VM
in the Smalltalk space (the running VM is actually a DLL supplied by Sun, IBM, or whoever).
The job of the JVM is mostly coordination, it is the one object that <EM>all</EM> other
objects in the system know about, and it allows them to find each other.  The JVM also
manages the process of starting up the Java VM and the JNIPort runtime machinery.
</P>
<P>
For a user of JNIPort, the main function of the JVM is that it knows how to find the
objects representing  Java classes &mdash; the &ldquo;class statics&rdquo;, of which
more below.  It also coordinates the <A href="#Class Registry">class registry</A>,
the <A href="#Class Index">class index</A>, and the
<A href="#Callback Registry">callback registry</A>, these are important parts of
the implementation of JNIPort; but are (to varying degrees) less relevant to JNIPort users.
</P>
<P>
JNIPort is designed to allow several JVMs to exist at once, since that is the way the JNI
API is structured.  In practice, there is little need for this (in fact, the current
crop of Java implementations don't support having more than one in the lifetime of a process).
It is possible to use JNIPort as if the JMV were a <EM>Singleton</EM>, and the
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JVM</CODE> class has a few methods like
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#current</CODE> (which answers &ldquo;the&rdquo; running instance
if there is one) and <CODE class="Smalltalk">#default</CODE> (which is the same, but will
also start up a default instance if necessary), to help with this.
</P>
<H2><A name="Class Statics">Class Statics</A></H2>
<P>
There is a great deal of truth in the observation that &ldquo;in Java, classes are not
objects&rdquo;. The &ldquo;static&rdquo; fields and methods of a Java class
are not associated with any object, they float in a sort of global space with
the Java class serving only to delimit a namespace and define accessibility.
Of course, for Smalltalk, that Just Won't Do&hellip;
</P>
<P>
JNIPort represents Java classes and interfaces by <DFN>class statics</DFN>.  These objects
(instances of subclasses of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE>) stand in a 1-to-1
relationship with Java classes.  They have similar roles to Smalltalk
classes (though they are not kinds of <CODE class="Smalltalk">Behavior</CODE>), they:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Know how to invoke the static methods of the Java class.</LI>
<LI>Know how to read and write the static fields of the Java class or interface.</LI>
<LI>Know how to create instances of the Java class.</LI>
<LI>Know their place in the Java class hierarchy.</LI>
<LI>Know how to do reflection.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
In addition, they can be specialised to a particular Java class, so they may
also:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Have methods corresponding to the static methods of the Java class.</LI>
<LI>Have getter and setter methods for the static fields of the Java class or interface.</LI>
<LI>Have factory methods corresponding to the constructors of the Java class.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
More strictly, the 1-to-1 relationship is that within the context of a JVM (since
each JVM has its own collection of class statics) there is a class static for each
<EM>known</EM> Java class, interface, or type.  For instance
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.String</CODE> (a class),
<CODE class="Java">java.util.Iterator</CODE> (an interface),
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.String[]</CODE> (an array class), and
<CODE class="Java">byte</CODE> (a primitive type), all have corresponding class statics.
The class statics for the array classes and primitive types are mainly used by the
internal machinery of JNIPort, although the array class statics do act as factories for
creating new Java arrays.
</P>
<P>
Each class static is paired with a Java instance wrapping a reference to a
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE>.  The class instance is the
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#classObject</CODE> of the class static, and the class
static is the <CODE class="Smalltalk">#classStatic</CODE> of the class object.
</P>
<P>
Whenever a new Java class becomes known to JNIPort, it is assigned a corresponding new class
static.  JNIPort can become aware of classes in several ways, including:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Calling <CODE class="Smalltalk">JVM>>findClass:</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>Seeing an instance of a class.</LI>
<LI>Seeing a subclass, or an instance of a subclass.</LI>
<LI>
Using Java's introspection methods such as
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class.forName()</CODE>.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The known class statics are held in the  <A href="#Class Registry">class registry</A>,
where they normally stay for the lifetime of the JVM, although there are exceptions
during bootstrapping.
A later version of JNIPort will provide some means of &ldquo;retiring&rdquo;
class statics that are no longer needed or used (thus allowing the Java class itself to be
garbage collected), but this version has no public API for doing so.
</P>
<P>
Class statics are specialised by subclassing.  You can create a subclass of JavaStatic
and arrange that some Java class, and all its subclasses, will have class statics that
are instances of your subclass.  This is set up by the class registry during
<A href="#Bootstrapping">bootstrapping</A>.  These specialised subclasses are
the <DFN>class-side wrapper classes</DFN>, and they are where the wrapper methods
live; you can also add whatever helper methods you want or need.  You can create
wrapper classes by hand, although it's tedious (as I know &mdash; I hand-wrote many
of the wrapper classes supplied as part of JNIPort), or you can generate them
automatically with the help of the <A href="wrapper-wizard.html">wrapper generation wizard</A>, 
or you can have them generated dynamically by using <A href="ghost-classes.html">ghost
classes</A>.
</P>
<P>
Class statics have another vital role that is internal to JNIPort: they know how to
wrap references to Java objects in Java Instances of the right kind.
Each class static knows a Smalltalk class to use to wrap references to instances of its
Java class, its <DFN>instance class</DFN>.  The instance class is normally the same as
the instance class for the Java superclass, but that can be changed during bootstrapping,
and when ghost classes are used.  This is discussed
in the section about the <A href="#Instance Lifecycle">lifecycle of an instance</A>, below.
</P>
One particular class static corresponds to the Java class
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE>, and that object has a special role to play
in the mechanism of JNIPort.  This is described in the section about the
<A href="#Class Static Lifecycle">lifecycle of a class static</A>, below.
<P>
</P>


<H2><A name="Java Instances">Java Instances</A></H2>
<P>
JNIPort represents references to Java objects by instances of (subclasses of)
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaClassInstance</CODE>.  Each instance has a reference to its
(shared) class static.
</P>
<P>
It is important to realise that these wrap <EM>references</EM> to Java objects,
and that there can be more than one reference to the same object.  The
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#=</CODE> and <CODE class="Smalltalk">#hash</CODE> methods are defined
so that they test for the Java identity of the referred-to objects, so
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#=</CODE> is true of two references when they refer to the same
Java object, even though they may not be <CODE class="Smalltalk">#==</CODE> to each other.
(By the way, the methods <CODE class="Smalltalk">#equals:</CODE> and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#hashCode</CODE> are the equivalents of the 
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object.Equals()</CODE> and
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object.hashCode()</CODE> methods, respectively).
</P>
<P>
In some cases, it is desirable or necessary to ensure that references are unique.
JNIPort includes a facility for making a reference to a Java object <DFN>canonical</DFN>;
and when this is used, any subsequent references to that object will be mapped to the
canonical instance.  This is available on a per-instance or per-class basis.  It is not
the default for most classes, since the &ldquo;interning&rdquo; is expensive and it is
not normally needed.
</P>
<P>
Internally to JNIPort, instance wrappers have the important role of managing the lifetime
of the object reference.  The Java VM needs to be told when references are discarded, or else
it can't do garbage collection properly, so instance wrappers are finalisable objects that
explicitly release the JNI reference when they die.  Some of the code refers to this, and
the rest of the mechanism of setting up wrapper objects, as <DFN>managed objects</DFN>.
</P>
<P>
For the user of JNIPort, the important thing about these objects is that they
act as <DFN>proxies</DFN> for the underlying object:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Know how to invoke the methods of the Java object.</LI>
<LI>Know how to read and write the fields of the Java object.</LI>
<LI>Know what class static they &ldquo;belong to&rdquo;.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
In addition, they can be specialised to a particular Java class, so they may
also:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Have methods corresponding to the methods of the Java object.</LI>
<LI>Have getter and setter methods for the fields of the Java object.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
As with class statics, proxies are specialised by subclassing.
In this case the custom <DFN>instance-side wrapper classes</DFN> are subclasses of
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaClassInstance</CODE> rather than
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaClassStatic</CODE>, but the idea is otherwise the same.
</P>
<P>
It might be worth explaining that instances can be either <DFN>local</DFN> or
<DFN>global</DFN>; this is a JNI concept.  JNI has two different kinds of
references to objects, and they are used and managed in slightly different ways.
Local references ought to be more efficient, but need to be managed more carefully.
It is possible that a future version of JNIPort will not use local references at all.
In any case, for user code, there should be no difference between local and global.
</P>

<H2>Other Players</H2>
<P>
There are some other notable objects in the JNIPort community.  These are mostly
concerned with the implementation of JNIPort, but they are intended to be visible
to the JNIPort user.
</P>
<H3><A name="Class Registry">The Class Registry</A></H3>
<P>
There is one <DFN>class registry</DFN> for each JVM object.  It holds the list of class
statics that JNIPort knows about.
</P>
<P>
Its role is mostly to ensure that every Java class and type is wrapped in exactly one
class static (for more details see the <A href="#Class Static Lifecycle">class lifecycle</A>
section, below).  However it is also able to provide lists of all the known classes, all
known subclasses of some superclass, and so on.
</P>
<H3><A name="Class Index">The Class Index</A></H3>
<P>
There is one <DFN>class index</DFN> for each JVM object.  It holds the mapping from the
names of classes and types (represented as Symbols, in fact) to the corresponding
class statics.  Classes may appear under more than one name (because of the weird JNI
naming rules, which are not relevant here &mdash; fortunately); also not all known classes
will appear in the index, only those that have been looked-up by name.  The index is
effectively a cache to allow <CODE class="Smalltalk">JVM>>findClass:</CODE> to avoid
going back to the Java runtime for known classes (which would be slow).
</P>
<P>
(Design note: The class index is actually a minor player, but it has a nasty habit
of trying to vanish and get its role absorbed into that of some other object &mdash;
which it then complicates unnecessarily. So I've dragged it out into the light of day
as a public player to try to stem the evil tendency.)
</P>
<H3><A name="Callback Registry">The Callback Registry</A></H3>
<P>
There is one <DFN>callback registry</DFN> for each JVM object that supports callbacks.
It holds references to the objects that &ldquo;tag&rdquo; callbacks (see the section on
<A href="callbacks.html">callbacks</A>), and is responsible for dispatching the incoming
callback requests or notifications to the correct handler for each tag.
</P>
<H3><A name="Ghost Class Maker">The Ghost Class Maker</A></H3>
<P>
There <EM>may</EM> be one <DFN>ghost class maker</DFN> for each JVM object.  If
there is, then its role is to wait for new Java classes to be registered and then
drive the creation of corresponding new ghost classes.
This is discussed a bit more under <A href="#Class Static Lifecycle">class lifecycle</A>,
below.
</P>
<P>
The ghost class maker is really only a public object because it has to be
<A href="setup.html">configured</A>.
</P>


<HR>
<H1><A name="The Play">The Play</A></H1>
<P>
This section is about the interactions between the main objects described
in the first section.  This is almost all about the <EM>implementation</EM> of
JNIPort &mdash; user-defined objects have no special role &mdash; but an overview
of how the system works may be helpful.
</P>

<H2><A name="Instance Lifecycle">The Lifecycle of an Instance</A></H2>
<P>
The process starts with a raw JNI reference to some Java object; it may have been
returned from a Java method call, for instance.  Before JNIPort can do anything
with the reference it must be wrapped in a Smalltalk object.  The process normally
starts with the JVM object&hellip;
</P>
<P>
The JVM object's role in life to put other objects in touch with each other.  In
this case the raw JNI reference needs to find a class static that will generate
a wrapper/proxy for it.
</P>
<P>
The JVM object starts by using low-level JNI features to get a reference to the Java
object's class.  This will answer a raw JNI pointer to a class object, and the
JVM will find a corresponding class static for it as described in the next section.
The JVM will then ask the newly discovered class static to wrap the original raw JNI
reference.
</P>
<P>
The class static may have canonical instances, if so then it must first check to
see if it already has a proxy for the same Java object.  It checks its
object registry (essentially just a weak set), if it has one, to see if
there is a match. If so then it releases the raw JNI pointer immediately,
and returns the pre-existing proxy to the caller.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise it creates a new proxy object.  This will be an instance of the
class static's &ldquo;instance class&rdquo;, it will hold the raw JNI reference
and know that it belongs to this class static.
</P>
<P>
If the particular class static is supposed make all instances canonical, then
it enters the new instance in its object registry.  Finally it returns the new
instance to the JVM.
</P>
<P>
An optimisation to this process is possible when the correct class static
is known (with certainty) <EM>before</EM> the raw reference is created.
In such cases there is no need to ask the JVM to wrap the reference, the class
static can be asked directly (which saves an expensive class lookup).  Some cases
where this optimisation can be applied are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
When a JNI method is called that is defined to return a reference to a class object
</LI>
<LI>
When a constructor is called (constructors always return an object of the exact class;
they can never answer an instance of some subclass).
</LI>
<LI>
When an element of an array of a &ldquo;final&rdquo; class is read.
</LI>
<LI>
When a method that returns an instance of a &ldquo;final&rdquo; class is called.
</LI>
<LI>
When a field holding an instance of a &ldquo;final&rdquo; class is read.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The first three cases are easy to code for and JNIPort applies them wherever possible.
The last two cases need significantly more messy code, so JNIPort only uses those
optimisations in ghost methods.
</P>
<P>
This process (of looking up a class static then creating a wrapper object) may
sound slow, and in fact it is. On my P3 650Mz laptop, JNIPort can wrap a maximum
of between 10K and 20K object references per second, depending on which
of the optimisations are applicable.
</P>

<H2><A name="Class Static Lifecycle">The Lifecycle of a Class Static</A></H2>
<P>
The previous sub-section and this one are quite closely intertwined; the lifecycle
of an instance is strongly affected by its &ldquo;onwing&rdquo; class static, but
the class static is paired with an <EM>instance</EM> of
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE>.
This makes it difficult to describe one separately from the other, it's a
chicken-and-egg situation. The same problem occurs in the code too, and
requires special handling as part of <A href="#Bootstrapping">bootstrapping</A>.
</P>
<P>
The lifecycle of a class static starts when the JVM object is asked to find a wrapper
for a raw JNI reference to an instance of <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE>.
This is a special case of wrapping any Java reference, and the previous section
talked about that in some detail, so it should suffice here to say that the JVM will
find the class static corresponding to <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE> and
then ask it to create a proxy for the Java object.
</P>
<P>
We'll call the specific class static for <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE> the
<DFN>Class class static</DFN> (for lack of a snappier name). The Class class static
now consults the class registry to see if it already has a proxy for
the same object.  If it has, then it then it releases the raw JNI object reference
and gives the pre-existing wrapper back to the caller.
This is an extension of the mechanism for making objects canonical; all instances of
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE> are automatically interned,
and kept as <EM>strong</EM> references in the class registry.
</P>
<P>
If the class registry does not find a pre-existing wrapper, then the Class
class static creates an instance of the correct proxy class for
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE>, in fact a
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangClass</CODE>, and adds it to the registry
before passing it back to the JVM.
</P>
<P>
So far this hardly differs from the normal processing for wrapping an
instance of any class with canonical instances (there are some differences
in the code, but those are mostly about efficiency, e.g. not using Mutexes
unnecessarily). What is different in this case is that the Class class static
<EM>also</EM> creates a new class static and pairs it with the new class
object before registering it.
</P>
<P>
To create the new class static, the Class class static must first choose a
Smalltalk class for it (I'm sorry if this is getting confusing &mdash; it goes
with the territory, like the &ldquo;metaclass knot&rdquo; in Smalltalk).  To
do this it tries to find the most applicable subclass of
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE> according to the following rules:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
If the class is an array class then use <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaArrayClassStatic</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI>
If the class is an interface then use <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInterfaceStatic</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI>
Otherwise the class must be a subclass of <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object</CODE>;
use the same class static class as is used for the target's Java superclass.  That
may involve re-entering this procedure to create a class static for the superclass,
but the recursion must eventually end with <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object</CODE>,
if not before.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
You may notice that these rules seem to imply that every normal class will be
given the same kind of class static (and you may also notice that Java's
primitive types aren't handled at all by the rules).  The answer is that
special arrangements are made during <A href="#Bootstrapping">bootstrapping</A>
to ensure that selected Java classes are given the &ldquo;right&rdquo; class statics.
For instance the class static for <CODE class="Java">java.lang.ClassLoader</CODE>
is an instance of the specialised subclass,
<CODE class="Smalltalk">StaticJavaLangClassLoader</CODE> (yeah, I know, the
names are getting longer and longer&hellip;).  As a result, once JNIPort is
up and running, if it sees any new subclass of <CODE class="Java">ClassLoader</CODE>,
then it will give it a class static that is also a
<CODE class="Smalltalk">StaticJavaLangClassLoader</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
The new class static and the new class object are now married together and
initialised.  They will stay associated for the rest of the lifetime of this
JVM, and any future references to the Java class will be mapped into the
existing class static.  The class is now considered to be <DFN>registered</DFN>.
</P>
<P>
The instance class of the new class static is set to be the same as that for the Java
superclass.
This seems to imply that the same kind of proxy is used for all Java references.
The answer is roughly the same as for class static classes: the instance
class can be changed during bootstrapping.  For instance, during bootstrapping
the class static for <CODE class="Java">java.lang.String</CODE> has its
instance class set so that any references to Java strings will be wrapped
in instances of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangString</CODE>.  (So too
would subclasses of <CODE class="Java">java.lang.String</CODE>, if it had any.)
</P>
<P>
One final flourish is worth mentioning: if ghost classes are in use, then at
this point the ghost class maker will be informed that a new class has been
registered.  Before the class static is returned to the JVM (remember, this
all started with the JVM being asked to wrap a JNI reference?), the ghost
class maker will convert it into a ghost class.
Details are <A href="ghost-classes.html">here</A> but, briefly, it will:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
Generate new ephemeral subclasses of the class static class and the instance class.
</LI>
<LI>
Use Java introspection to discover what fields and methods the Java class has.
</LI>
<LI>
Populate the ghost classes with methods that use the low-level JNI APIs to call those
methods or get/set those fields.
</LI>
<LI>
Replace (using <CODE class="Smalltalk">#become:</CODE>) the class static by an
instance of the new ghost static class, and tell it that it should use the new
ghost instance class.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
The <A href="setup.html">configuration</A> controls exactly which classes are
converted into ghosts and which members of those classes are exposed via ghost
methods.
</P>

<H2><A name="Bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</A></H2>
<P>
JNIPort, being fairly complicated internally, has a correspondingly elaborate
startup sequence.  Most of it is routine, even dull, and is in any case is not
relevant to JNIPort users.  One aspect of it, however, is relevant: the process of
<DFN>bootstrapping</DFN>.  This process initialises the class registry and sets up
the mechanism for wrapping Java classes and objects.
</P>
<P>
I call it &ldquo;bootstrapping&rdquo; because that mechanism is managed largely
by the class static for <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE>, but that
object (a class static like any other) depends on the machinery.  So there is
some slightly tricky code for avoiding the circularity while setting up the
initial objects in the class registry.  The
class statics for <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE> and
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object</CODE> and instance classes for
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE>, <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object</CODE>,
and <CODE class="Java">java.lang.String</CODE> all refer to, and depend on, each
other. Once that knot of mutually-referential objects has been created, the class
registry enters the second phase of bootstrapping.
</P>
<P>
The second phase is where custom subclasses of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInstance</CODE>
and <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE> are registered as the preferred
wrapper classes for corresponding Java classes.  The mechanism might strike you
as a bit of a hack (it should, because it <EM>is</EM> a hack), but it is
reasonably simple, and it is normally only used during bootstrapping.
</P>
<P>
Each subclass of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInstance</CODE> or
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE> is given a chance to <DFN>register</DFN>
with the JVM object that is starting up.  The class is sent the
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#registerWrapperWith:</CODE> message (passing the new
JVM as a parameter). Superclasses are always asked to register before their
subclasses, but there is no defined ordering other than that.  The default
handing is as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>
If the class does not think that it is a wrapper class (it may be an
abstract superclass of concrete wrappers) then it ignores the message.
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
Otherwise, the class will do a <CODE class="Smalltalk">#findClass:</CODE> on
the name of the Java class that it wraps.  That will answer a class static
in the normal way, but because the class registry is not yet fully initialised,
the new class static will <EM>not</EM> reflect the intended custom wrapper
classes.  So that has to be fixed.
</P></LI>

If the Smalltalk class is an instance-side wrapper, let's say the Smalltalk class is
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaIoReader</CODE> which is intended to wrap instances of
<CODE class="Java">java.io.Reader</CODE>, then the instance class of the new class
static will be wrong.  It'll probably be <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangObject</CODE>
&mdash; the default.  In this case <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaIoReader</CODE>
can register itself as the proper instance class by changing the instance
class reference held by the class static.
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
If the Smalltalk class is a class-side wrapper, for example
<CODE class="Smalltalk">StaticJavaLangSystem</CODE> corresponding to
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.System</CODE>, the new class static will be
an instance of the wrong class (it'll be a
<CODE class="Smalltalk">StaticJavaLangObject</CODE>).  So
<CODE class="Smalltalk">StaticJavaLangSystem</CODE> creates a new instance of itself,
initialised with the data from the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; class static, and uses
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#become:</CODE> to replace the old with the new.
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
A small subtlety here is that after the class static has been modified or replaced,
the class registry must be updated by making corresponding changes to any
other class static that have &ldquo;inherited&rdquo; its settings.  In the
current implementation this is unnecessary, since there won't be any, but
that cannot be relied on for future implementations.  The nett effect
is that any particular class static <EM>may</EM> change several times during
bootstrapping.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P>
By the time bootstrapping is finished, each Java class that has a custom
wrapper class (on class or instance side) will have a class static in the
registry, and that static will reflect the intended wrappers.  The class
static and instance class should now be stable for the rest of the life
of the owning JVM.   The exceptions are when ghost classes are used (in which
case the ghost classes will be installed later using much the same mechanism)
or when you manually register a new wrapper class (say, by using the wrapper
generation wizard).
</P>
<P>
You may notice that instance wrappers and class-side wrappers are
installed independently &mdash; a Java class may have an instance wrapper, or
a class wrapper, or both, and if it has both then the two do not need to know
about each other.  Also there is no requirement that the class hierarchy of the
wrapper classes follows the Java class hierarchy, though it would be confusing
if the two were too far out of synch.  For instance, the JNIPort wrappers for
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.String</CODE> and the various Java array classes
all share an abstract superclass, <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaAggregate</CODE>,
even though there is no formal relationship between them in Java.
