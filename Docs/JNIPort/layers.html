<H1>JNIPort Layers</H1>
<P>
JNIPort is built in three layers, each in several packages.  The lowest level simply
uses Dolphin's external interface feature to talk to Java's JNI; the middle layer provides
Smalltalk-flavoured access to Java objects; the topmost level generates wrapper classes that 
automatically forward Smalltalk-style messages to the underlying Java objects.
</P>
<P>
Here's a rough diagram of the components and how they are layered.  The picture is not to-scale.

<P>
The rest of this section gives a short overview of each of the layers, and pointers to the
more detailed documentation on each.  It may be helpful as a kind of map, both
of JNIPort and of its documentation.
</P>
<P>
For a different view of how the bits fit together, you might prefer the description
of the main <A href="players.html">players</A> in the community of objects that form
JNIPort.
</P>

<HR>
<H2><A name="JRT">Layer 0: Java Runtime</A></H2>
<P>
This is really the bottom layer. This is the software provided by Sun, or whoever
implemented the JVM you are using.
</P>
<P>
For some discussion of what JVMs are supported, see <A href="jvms.html">JVMs</a>.
</P>


<HR>
<H2>Layer 1: JNI etc.</H2>
<P>
This layer is all low-level stuff.  The things we need to have in order
to talk to the JVM, but which we don't want to think or know about when
we're programming.  Down here in the muck and mire we have raw pointers,
objects that don't clean up after themselves, explicit memory allocation,
and all the other things that one hopes to avoid by programming in Smalltalk.
</P>

<H3><A name="JNI">1.1 &mdash; JNI Interface</A></H3>
<P>
The lowest layer of JNIPort, in package 'CU JNI', is just a simple wrapper
around the raw JNI interface.  Unless you know JNI <EM>and</EM> happen to be a
masochist then this will be of very little interest to you.  This layer sits
directly above the Java runtime environment (i.e. the running JVM) and talks to
it via JNI.  JNI is a very low-level API, designed primarily for hairy-arsed
C-programmers; it works, but is certainly not pretty.
</P>
<P>
For more details see <A href="jni.html">JNI</A>.
</P>

<H3><A name="HDLL">1.2 &mdash; JNI Helper DLL</A></H3>
<P>
At the same level is an optional package, 'CU JNI Helper' that uses a small additional
DLL to provide workarounds for a couple of problems caused by the mismatch between JNI's
and Dolphin's threading models.  This package is optional in that the rest of JNIPort
<EM>can</EM> be used without it; however, layers higher than the raw JNI wrapper will
work better (i.e. deadlock less) if it is present too.
</P>
<P>
For more details see <A href="jni-helper.html">JNI-Helper</A> and
<A href="threading.html">the problem with threads</A>.
</P>

<H3><A name="JCC">1.3 &mdash; Java Callback Classes</A></H3>
<P>
There are also some helper classes written in Java which likewise are
workarounds for problems caused by the mismatch between JNI's and Dolphin's
threading models.  These classes are necessary to allow callbacks from Java to
Smalltalk, but are not otherwise needed.
</P>
<P>
For more details see <A href="threading.html">the problem with threads</A>
and <A href="callbacks.html">Callbacks</A>.
</P>

<H3><A name="QUTF">1.4 &mdash; Quasi-UTF8</A></H3>
<P>
All String data that passes in/out of the JVM uses a weird encoding of 16-bit
characters as 8-bit bytes.  The encoding is in some ways similar to UTF8, but
is <EM>definitely not </EM> the same.  For some reason, all the Sun documentation
tends to call it UTF8, which is irritating as well as confusing.  The
'CU Java Quasi-UTF8' package provides the relevant encoders/decoders.
</P>


<HR>
<H2>Layer 2: Basic Features</H2>
<P>
Layer two puts a level of sanity around the raw access to JNI.  Although useable, it is still
quite inconvenient, since you still have to type in all the tedious stuff about method
parameter types, and so on.  This layer exists primarily in order to allow the bootstrapping
of the much handier, automatic, facilities at level three.  However most of the important concepts
you will need to use JNIPort &mdash; such as <EM>class statics</EM> &mdash; are defined at
this level, so you will need to know about it even if you are using the level three APIs.
</P>

<H3><A name="JB">2.1 &mdash; Java Base</A></H3>
<P>
The lowest-level API that I'd expect anyone sane (who wanted to <EM>stay</EM> sane)
to  program against is in package 'CU Java Base'.  This wraps the raw JNI references
in proper Smalltalk objects.  It provides:
</P>
<UL compact>
	<LI><P>
		A framework within which Java objects are automatically wrapped in
		Smalltalk objects of the most appropriate class.  An important feature of
		this mapping is that Java classes are also wrapped in Smalltalk objects
		(class-like, but not inheriting from Class or Behaviour), and this is
		where the &ldquo;static&rdquo; Java methods, constructors, and fields
		are presented.
	</P></LI>
	<LI><P>
		A convenient (as compared with using JNI) way of calling Java methods
		and accessing fields in Java objects.  These features are fairly low-level,
		and are intended mainly as a foundation to build upon.
	</P></LI>
	<LI><P>
		Automatic lifetime management of JNI &ldquo;references&rdquo;.
	</P></LI>
	<LI><P>
		Simple access to Java's reflective features.
	</P></LI>
	<LI><P>
		A set of classes for wrapping some common or important Java classes.
		These provide Smalltalk-style methods that are mapped onto the underlying
		Java methods.
	</P></LI>
</UL>
<P>
The idea is that rather than use the features of Java Base to call methods of Java objects
directly (which is messy, repetitive, and error-prone), it's better to write your own
Smalltalk-style methods that call the raw Java Base facilities.  Usually you create
a specific wrapper class (or two if you want to wrap static Java methods too) for each
Java class (or interface) that you are interested in.  You write whatever wrapper methods
you think you'll need. Then the JNIPort runtime will arrange to wrap all references to Java
objects of that class (and its subclasses) in instances of your own class.
</P>
<P>
The features in level three provide a way of automating this process.
</P>
<P>
This level does include a fair selection of pre-defined wrappers for commonly occurring Java
classes and interfaces.
</P>
<P>
For a more complete description of how it works and how to use it, see
<A href="java-base.html">Java Base</A>, and also these
<A href="java-base-example-1.html">examples</A>.
</P>

<H3><A name="AW">2.2 &mdash; Additional Wrappers</A></H3>
<P>
<P>At about the same level, another package, 'CU Java Additional Wrappers', has
some more pre-defined wrappers for other common Java classes and interfaces, such
as the Java2 Collections.
</P>
<P>
These are split out from 'CU Java Base' only because they aren't <EM>necessary</EM>
in order to use Java from Smalltalk &mdash; especially if you are using dynamic
wrapper generation.
<P>
For more details see <A href="additional-wrappers.html">Additional Wrappers</A>
</P>

<H3><A name="JC">2.3 &mdash; Java Callbacks</A></H3>
<P>
The 'CU Java Callbacks' package supplements the Java Base with the ability
to call back from Java into Smalltalk.
</P>
<P>
Since Java has no notion of a function pointer, what we really mean by callbacks is
that JNI allows you to define the implementation of Java's &ldquo;native methods&rdquo;.
JNIPort gives you an <EM>extremely limited</EM> ability to specify the implementation in
Smalltalk.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the limitation is <A href="threading.html">the problem with threads</A>.
</P>
<P>
In practice you are more-or-less forced to make use of the Java callback helper
classes.  These define an interface for sending <DFN>requests</DFN> (which wait for
a reply), or <DFN>notifications</DFN> (which don't), from Java into Smalltalk.
These features are implemented on top of the raw callbacks and shield you (mostly)
from the limitations.
</P>
<P>
For more information on how to use Java callbacks, request, and notifications, not to
mention their inherent problems, see <A href="callbacks.html">Callbacks</A>.
</P>


<HR>
<H2>Layer 3: Top-level stuff</H2>
<P>
This level contains the stuff that you'll probably use most.  It provides convenient
ways to generate Smalltalk wrapper classes for Smalltalk classes.  It is also the
layer where the GUI tools live (a somewhat arbitrary placement, but they've got to
fit in <EM>somewhere</EM>).
</P>
<P>
However, do remember that this layer still makes very heavy use of the concepts from the
Java Base level (layer two), so you'll need to understand that before you can make best
use of these features.
</P>

<H3><A name="SGW">3.1 &mdash; Static Wrappers</A></H3>
<P>
Since Java has reflection it's natural to use it to generate Smalltalk wrapper
classes automatically; in fact JNIPort includes two ways to do that.
</P>
<P>
One way is statically, via the 'CU Java Wrapper Generation' package.  This provides
facilities for generating a class- or instance-side wrapper for a Java class or interface.
</P>
<P>
This part of JNIPort is a framework that uses introspection to ask a Java class what methods,
fields, and constructors it has; the framework then uses that to generate Smalltalk methods
that will call those methods or act as accessors for the fields.  The JNIPort runtime
automatically wraps references to Java objects in the most specific available wrapper class
(just as it would for manually created wrapper classes written using the Java Base features
in layer two).
</P>
<P>
Since, in Java, the signature of a method is part of its &ldquo;name&rdquo;, and overloading
of method names is, in fact, very common in Java libraries, we have to make the (Smalltalk)
names of the wrapper methods reflect the parameter types in some way.  The automatically
generated wrappers use a specific <A href="method-names.html">naming scheme</A>, which is an
attempt (not always successful) to find a good compromise between frequent ambiguity and
insufferable verbosity.
</P>
<P>
For a more complete description see <A href="wrapper-classes.html">Static Wrappers</A>
and also these <A href="wrapper-example-1.html">examples</A>.
</P>
<P>
There is GUI tool to help with generating these wrapper classes; see the
<A href="wrapper-wizard.html">Wrapper Wizard</A>.
</P>


<H3><A name="DGW">3.2 &mdash; Dynamic Wrappers (Ghost classes)</A></H3>
<P>
The other way to generate wrapper classes is to do it dynamically, and on demand.
The approach I've chosen to take is to use what I call <DFN>ghost classes</DFN>.
Ghost classes are dynamically generated ephemeral classes.  They do not appear in the
&ldquo;official&rdquo; class hierarchy (so you don't see them in the browsers) and
they only live for as long as the connection to a JVM.  Ghost classes use exactly the
same <A href="method-names.html">naming scheme</A> as statically generated wrappers.
</P>
<P>
Using ghost classes is the highest level of JNIPort, and is my preferred way of driving
Java from Smalltalk.
<P>
The ghost class implementation is in the package 'CU Java Ghost Classes'.
</P>
<P>
More details about ghost classes and some discussion the relative benefits of static
and dynamic wrappers is at <A href="ghost-classes.html">Ghost Classes</A>. Also there
are these <A href="wrapper-example-1.html">examples</A>.
</P>

<H3><A name="SM">3.3 &mdash; Status Monitoring</A></H3>
<P>
The Status Monitor is a GUI tool for starting, stopping, and monitoring the status of
running JVMs.  Among other things, it can be configured to display:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>A class tree of all the known Java classes.</LI>
<LI>A histogram of how many references to Java objects are created/released per second.</LI>
<LI>A histogram of Java callbacks made per second.</LI>
<LI>A trace of the JVM's debugging stream.</LI>
<LI>A trace of the text sent to the Java console streams, java.lang.System.out and
java.lang.System.err.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
It is also the entry-point for the GUI to generating static wrapper classes.
</P>
<P>
