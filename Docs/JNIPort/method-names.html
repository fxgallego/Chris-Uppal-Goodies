<H1>Names of Generated Wrapper Methods</H1>
<P>
The topmost level of JNIPort is capable of generating wrapper Smalltalk classes for
existing Java classes.  The wrapper class has automatically-generated methods that
allow you to use the Java object as if it were a Smalltalk object.
</P>
<P>The generated methods are of two kinds:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<DFN>Forwarding methods</DFN> that collect together their arguments and forward them to the
corresponding method of the underlying Java object.
</LI>
<LI>
<DFN>Accessor methods</DFN> that read or set the fields of the underlying Java object.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>In both cases, the name of the Smalltalk method is determined by following a set pattern.
The rest of this section describes the pattern in detail, but first, here are a few examples:

<H2>Names for Forwarding Methods</H2>

<P>
Given a Java class, each of its methods is fully identified by a combination of
its name and its signature &mdash; the name alone is not enough (since method names
can be overloaded).  Hence, to identify a specific method, we need:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The method's name.</LI>
<LI>The method's return type.</LI>
<LI>The types of all of the method's parameters, in order.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In practice, the method's return type can be ignored since Java does not allow overloading
on return type (although the JVM itself <EM>does</EM>).  So, we can think of a Java method's
&ldquo;full&rdquo; name as being somehow composed of its normal name and the types of
any arguments.  The names of generated Smalltalk methods follow this thinking.
</P>
<P>
(By the way, if you are using a version of Java that supports so-called &ldquo;generics&rdquo;
then you will need to know that generics are invisble to the Java runtime (they are
merely a hack implemented entirely in the Java compiler), and so they are invisible
to JNPort too.  The types seen by the Java runtime are what determine the correct names
to use, and they are the names of the generic types after &ldquo;erasure&rdquo;.  If you think
that's messy or awkward, then I agree with you, but it's not <em>my</em> fault &mdash;
Sun have done everyone a disservice by introducing the underpowered, overcomplicated,
and largely pointless hack into the language.)
<P>
The general pattern is that a Java method called, say, &ldquo;aMethod()&rdquo;, with
arguments of types &ldquo;Type1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Type2&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Type3&rdquo;,
</P><PRE><CODE class="Java">	int aMethod(Type1 a, Type2 b, Type3 c) { ... }
</CODE></PRE><P>
will be represented by a Smalltalk method with selector
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#aMethod_Type1:Type2:Type3:</CODE>.
That is, the first keyword of the Smalltalk selector is the name of the Java method, followed
by an underscore, '_', and then the type of the first argument.  Subsequent keywords are
just the types of the corresponding arguments.
</P>
<P>
In more detail:
</P>
<P>
If the Java method is called <CODE class="Java">aMethod()</CODE>, say, then the Smalltalk
method will be called: <CODE class="Smalltalk">#aMethod_null</CODE>.
The '_null' is important since it prevents name
clashes between native Smalltalk method names and generated Java methods with
unrelated meanings.
</P>
<P>
If the Java method, called 'aMethod', has one or more arguments, then the Smalltalk
method's selector will be formed by starting with 'aMethod_' and then appending a
segment for each of the arguments.  Each segment will be the name of that argument's
type, simplified by following the rules below.
</P>
<P>
If the type is a primitive, then the segment will just be the name of that primitive.
Note: the case is <EM>not</EM> changed, so a Java method like:
</P><PRE><CODE class="Java">	int multiply(int n, int m) { ... }
</CODE></PRE><P>
would be represented by a Smalltalk method called
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#multiply_int:int:</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
If the type is a class or interface, then the segment is the short name of that class
or interface (i.e. not fully qualified).  E.g. a Java method like:
</P><PRE><CODE class="Java">	void write(java.lang.String message, java.io.WriteStream out) { ... }
</CODE></PRE><P>
would be represented by a Smalltalk method called
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#write_String:WriteStream:</CODE>.
Note that, again, the case of the type name is unchanged (and so does not follow
conventional Smalltalk rules &mdash; again, this is necessary to avoid ambiguity).
</P>
<P>
If the type is an array type, then the segment is formed by appending 'Array'
to the base-type name as many times as necessary.  E.g: a Java method like:
</P><PRE><CODE class="Java">	void aMethod(String[] strings, boolean[][] bitmaps) { ... }
</CODE></PRE><P>
would be represented by a Smalltalk method called:
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#aMethod_StringArray:booleanArrayArray:</CODE>.
</P>


<H2>Names for Accessor Methods</H2>
<P>
Access to fields of Java objects is via generated Smalltalk accessor methods.
Given a variable called 'aField', the generated getter and setter methods in
Smalltalk are called <CODE class="Smalltalk">#get_aField</CODE> and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">set_aField:</CODE> respectively.  Fields declared to
be &ldquo;final&rdquo; have no generated setter.
</P>

<H2>Names for Static Members</H2>
<P>
Using static members (class side fields and methods)
follows exactly the same pattern as instance-side members.  The difference
is that the Smalltalk methods are defined on a &ldquo;class static&rdquo; object
that stands for the Java class.  See <A href="players.html#Class Statics">Class Statics</A>
for more detail.
</P>
<P>
It's worth mentioning that, because of this, there is never any ambiguity between
class-side and instance-side members.
</P>

<H2>Names for Constructors</H2>
<P>
These are treated like static methods called &ldquo;new&rdquo;.  E.g. the
Java constructor for a java.lang.String from an array of chars:
</P><PRE><CODE class="Java">	String(char[] chars) { ... }
</CODE></PRE><P>
is represented by a method on the String class static called
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#new_charArray</CODE>:
</P>


<H2>Handling Ambiguity</H2>
<P>
It is possible for more than one Java method to map onto the same Smalltalk selector.
It is impossible to fix the problem in general (without making the scheme too verbose or
complicated to use), but the most common cases can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
One way ambiguity occurs is when there are two versions of a class or interface
with the same name in different packages. If a method is overloaded to handle both
of these cases (a not unreasonable situation) then JNIPort will try to generate
two corresponding Smalltalk wrapper methods with the same selector. (Since the
two argument types have the same short name).  Other ways of getting ambiguity can
also be invented; I leave it as an exercise for the reader&hellip;
</P>
<P>
If JNIPort finds that it is generating two methods with the same selector, then it
attempts to get around the problem as follows.  Firstly it tries using the long forms
of all the type names.  So if the Java class had two methods like:
</P><PRE><CODE class="Java">	void aMethod(org.whatever.Something) { ... }
	void aMethod(org.wherever.Something) { ... }
</CODE></PRE><P>
then JNIPort would generate a method called <CODE class="Smalltalk">#aMethod_Something:</CODE>
that just threw an <CODE class="Smalltalk">AmbiguousJavaMethodError</CODE> exception.  It would
also generate two real forwarding methods with names
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#aMethod_orgwhateverSomething:</CODE> and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#aMethod_orgwhereverSomething:</CODE> that forwarded to the
corresponding methods.  In this case the segment of the selector is made from the fully-qualified
type name with any '.'s removed.
</P>
<P>
If that does not resolve the ambiguity then JNIPort will generate even longer selectors
that also include the return type of the method, so that:
</P><PRE><CODE class="Java">	int aMethod(org.whatever.Something) { ... }
	double aMethod(org.what.ever.Something) { ... }
</CODE></PRE><P>
would be wrapped as <CODE class="Smalltalk">#aMethod_int_orgwhateverSomething:</CODE>
and <CODE class="Smalltalk">#aMethod_double_orgwhateverSomething:</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
This is already getting to the point of being unusable, so if even <EM>that</EM> doesn't work
then JNIPort just gives up.  In the current implementation, it will generate both wrapper
methods in the longest form, and so one of them (arbitrarily chosen) will overwrite the
other.  It would probably be better if it didn't generate either of them in this case, so the
current behaviour should be considered to be a bug.
</P>
<P>
Rather surprisingly, the JVM allows classes to have multiple fields with the same
name, provided that they are of different declared types.  The Java compiler won't
let you do it, but it is perfectly legal for JVM classfiles.  In this case JNIPort
will use the same kinds of techniques as it does for avoiding ambiguous selectors
for forwarding methods (arguably, this is overkill).  So if the Java class had fields
like (this is not legal Java):
</P><PRE><CODE class="Java">	int aField;
	double aField;
</CODE></PRE><P>
then JNIPort will generate two getter methods with names:
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#get_int_aField</CODE>, and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#get_double_aField</CODE>, and will generate a dummy getter,
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#get_aField</CODE> that raises an
<CODE class="Smalltalk">AmbiguousJavaMethodError</CODE> exception.  Similarly for setter
methods if there are any.
</P>
<P>
If this sort of thing happens to you in practice, then you can always fall back to
the Java Base and write your own wrapper methods with whatever names you want.
</P>
