<H1>Calling from Java into Smalltalk</H1>
<P>
JNIPort has a limited ability to allow Java code to <DFN>callback</DFN> into Smalltalk.
I must emphasise that the operative word here is <EM>limited</EM>; the feature
is not suitable for creating a tight integration between the two worlds because:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>It requires much more effort from the programmer than I'm happy with.</LI>
<LI>It is slow.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
However, it is better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
An example of using it to display the Smalltalk class hierarchy in a Swing
<CODE class="Java">JTree</CODE> component is <A href="callback-example-1.html">
here</A>.
</P>


<HR>
<H2>The Callback Queue</H2>
<P>
Java's &ldquo;native&rdquo;, as it were, way of calling out from Java to another
language is to use &ldquo;native method&rdquo;, which are like normal Java methods
except that a programmer uses JNI to implement the method body, rather than
writing it in Java.  Because of the <A href="threading.html">problem with threads</A>
(which you should read if you are thinking of using callbacks at all), JNIPort
does not directly support this way of working (although it is used internally
by JNIPort).  Instead it provides Java classes that maintain a <DFN>queue</DFN>
of <DFN>Requests</DFN> and <DFN>Notifications</DFN>; you create a request or
notification (collectively a callback, or callback object) and place it on the
queue, Dolphin takes requests off the queue and processes them, then returns
the answer (if any is required) to the caller.   The section on threads talks
about the implementation of this queue, this section is about how to use it.
</P>
<P>
The section on the problem with threads provides much more detail, but it is
important to realise that the way that the queue works depends crucially on
the operating system thread that is using it.  Dolphin executes all Smalltalk
code on one OS thread, which I call the <DFN>Smalltalk thread</DFN>, and if
that thread is executing Java code then no Smalltalk code can run at all.
This has implications for anyone programming with callbacks.
One consequence is that you have to be careful about deadlocks (the threads
section has the details), another is that callbacks made from the Smalltalk
thread are handled differently from those made by other threads.
</P>
<P>
If Java code running on some other thread issues a callback, then the callback
object is placed on the queue and then that thread either waits for a response,
or just goes about its other business.  Dolphin, running on the Smalltalk thread,
will see the request, process it, and (optionally) return an answer to the caller.
On the other hand, if the Java code was running on the Smalltalk thread in
the first place, then it places the callback on the queue in the normal way, and
then calls back (a JNI callback) into Dolphin where all the requests on the
requests on the queue are handled before control returns to the original caller.
(So the caller is blocked, as far as Java is concerned, even if it did not want
to wait for an answer.)
</P>


<HR>
<H2>Callback Objects</H2>
<P>
Callback objects are instances of the Java classes
<CODE class="Java">org.metagnostic.jniport.DolphinRequest</CODE> and
<CODE class="Java">.DolphinNotification</CODE>.  They all have a
<DFN>tag</DFN>, an <DFN>originator</DFN>, and a <DFN>parameter</DFN>.  The
tag is a Java object (of any class) that uniquely identifies the callback;
it us used by the callback registry (see below) to find the corresponding
Smalltalk handler (I tend to use Strings for tags since they are easy to
identify in logs or the debugger), the tag must not be <CODE class="Java">null</CODE>.
The originator can be any object, or <CODE class="Java">null</CODE>; it is
conventionally used to identify the <CODE class="Java">this</CODE> of the
callback.  The parameter likewise can be any object or <CODE class="Java">null</CODE>,
and is conventionally used to pass any arguments (possibly as an array)
to the callback.  JNIPort makes no use of the originator and tag, they are
passed through to the handler code without interpretation.
</P>
<P>
You supply the tag, originator, and parameter when you create a notification object
(there are also a bunch of convenience constructors that package
arguments up into the parameter object in various ways).  You send a notification
by invoking its <CODE class="Java">send()</CODE> method.  If Dolphin has
initialised the callback queue then the object will be placed on the queue
and <CODE class="Java">send()</CODE> will return immediately (subject to
the above caveat about Java code executing on the Smalltalk thread).  If Dolphin
has not initialised the queue then it will throw an
<CODE class="Java">org.metagnostic.jniport.RequestNotHandedException</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
The pattern is similar for requests, the important difference is that
Dolphin will supply either a return value or will record the fact that
an exception was thrown from the handler.  The simplest way to get the return
value is to call the request object's <CODE class="Java">value()</CODE> method.
It will block until Dolphin has handled the request and then either return
the <CODE class="Java">Object</CODE> returned by the handler, or will throw
an exception. The exception can be any of:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>
A <CODE class="Java">RequestNotHandedException</CODE> indicating that
Dolphin was not listening for requests on the queue.
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
A <CODE class="Java">RequestNotHandedException</CODE> indicating that
no handler had been set for the callback's tag.
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
Any Java <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Throwable</CODE> that was thrown
from the Smalltalk handler code (and not caught in the handler).
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
A <CODE class="Java">RequestNotHandedException</CODE> indicating that
the handler threw an uncaught Smalltalk exception.
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
A <CODE class="Java">RequestNotHandedException</CODE> indicating that
the handler did not answer a valid Java object or nil (this is really
a special case of the previous case, but it's worth mentioning explicitly).
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P>
You can, instead, call the request object's <CODE class="Java">startEvaluation()</CODE>
method.  This puts the request on the queue but does not wait for an answer
from Dolphin (unless, as mentioned above, it is running on the Smalltalk thread).
You can then call <CODE class="Java">value()</CODE> later which will only then
block until Dolphin has processed the request (it may already have done so, in
which case there is no blocking).  Or you can use accessor methods like
<CODE class="Java">getException()</CODE>, and
<CODE class="Java">getReturnValue()</CODE>.  These also block until
the answer from Dolphin is available, but they do not throw exceptions.
</P>


<HR>
<H2>The Callback Registry</H2>
<P><EM>
Please note:
I am still unhappy with the details of how handlers are set and invoked &mdash;
expect changes in future versions of JNIPort.
</EM></P>
<P>
On the other side of the wall, in Smalltalk space, Java callbacks are
managed by the <DFN>callback registry</DFN>.  It takes callback objects off
the queue, and then uses each request's tag to find the corresponding
<DFN>handler</DFN>.  The handler is an object that understands
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#value:value:</CODE>.  The callback registry
looks up the handler in a lookup table keyed by the callback's tag (it's
an identity comparison of Java objects) and then evaluates the handler
passing in the callback's originator and parameter as arguments.
</P>
<P>
If the callback was a Notification, then the handler is evaluated in a
context where all Smalltalk or Java exceptions are trapped and ignored.
The result of evaluating the handler is also discarded.
</P>
<P>
If the callback was a request then the handler is evaluated in a
context where all Smalltalk or Java exceptions are trapped and recorded
in the request object.  If no exception is thrown, then the result of
evaluating the handler is recorded in the request.  This <EM>must</EM>
be a Java object or <CODE class="Smalltalk">nil</CODE> (i.e. Java's 
<CODE class="Java">null</CODE>).
</P>
<P>
Once the handler has returned, JNIPort notifies the callback object
that it is now &ldquo;complete&rdquo; which wakes up any Java thread
that was blocked waiting for the result. 
</P>
<P>
You find the callback registry by sending <CODE class="Smalltalk">callbackRegistry</CODE>
to the JVM object.  Handlers are set by sending
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#setCallback:handler:</CODE>, and removed with
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#clearCallback:</CODE>.  There are also some higher-level
methods in the 'operations' category of class
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaCallbackRegistry</CODE> that are intended to make
it easier to arrange various kinds of handlers.
</P>


<HR>
<H2><A name="Events">Java Events</A></H2>
<P>
Fortunately Java API's do not often make very much use of coding patterns
that would require callbacks from Java to Smalltalk; for example Java's
idiomatic pattern of iteration uses <EM>external</EM> iterators
(<CODE class="Java">java.util.Iterator</CODE> and
<CODE class="Java">java.util.Enumeration</CODE>) rather than <EM>internal</EM>
ones like Smalltalk's idiomatic use of <CODE class="Smalltalk">#do:</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
There is one glaring exception to this tendency: AWT/Swing &ldquo;events&rdquo;.
Java (since version 1.4) has provided some support for handling events without
having to code explicit subclasses (like inner classes, for instance), and
JNIPort builds on that to provide a way to translate Java events into Smalltalk
events.
</P>
<P>
This part of Java is new enough to warrant a little background explanation.
</P>
<P>
In Java, an event is represented by a method in an interface.  For instance the
window closing event is represented by the <CODE class="Java">windowClosing()</CODE>
method in interface <CODE class="Java">java.awt.event.WindowListener</CODE>.
The window maintains a list of &ldquo;listeners&rdquo; that all implement
<CODE class="Java">WindowListener</CODE>, and when it closes it calls each
one's <CODE class="Java">windowClosing()</CODE> method.  Additional data
about the event is passed as a parameter that is some subclass of 
<CODE class="Java">java.util.EventObject</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
The normal way that some other object &ldquo;receives&rdquo; the event is that
it (or one of its inner-class objects) implements the
<CODE class="Java">WindowListener</CODE> interface, and overrides 
<CODE class="Java">windowClosing()</CODE> with its own code to handle
the event.  That works fairly well in most cases, but it does mean that creating
a handler always requires some kind of subclassing.
</P>
<P>
Java 1.4 introduced a new way of creating handlers that is less inflexible,
<DFN>Proxies</DFN> and <DFN>Invocation Handlers</DFN>.  A proxy is an adaptor
that is created to implement some interface by forwarding the event methods
to an invocation handler.  The invocation handler is a object with the single
method, <CODE class="Java">invoke()</CODE>, and the proxy calls it for every
event method (passing parameters that identify the event and its arguments).
You create a proxy by identifying one or more interfaces that you want it
to implement, and then the Java runtime creates a stub class on the fly
that implements the methods of the interfaces by forwarding them to an
invocation handler.  (I'm simplifying quite a bit, see 
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler</CODE> and
<CODE class="Java">.Proxy</CODE> for the details).
</P>
<P>
JNIPort uses this to translate Java events into Smalltalk events.
To observe (in Smalltalk) events generated by some Java object, you first
find the event method represented as a
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.reflect.Method</CODE>. Probably the easiest way
to do this is to look in the <CODE class="Smalltalk">#abstractMethods</CODE>
list of the <EM>interface's</EM> class static; that will find a 
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangReflectMethod</CODE> instance that wraps the
Java reflection object.
</P>
<P>
Next you ask it for an event forwarder.  JNIPort uses the new Java features
to create a listener for the event (i.e. an object implementing the interface)
which forwards the event data (the <CODE class="Java">java.util.EventObject</CODE>)
to Dolphin.  You create the forwarder by sending
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#eventForwarder:</CODE>
to the method object. The parameter is the event Symbol that is to be triggered
in Smalltalk space.  The alternative form,
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#asynchronousEventForwarder:</CODE>, is identical except
that the data is passed in a Notification instead of a Request.
</P>
<P>
A side effect of <CODE class="Smalltalk">#eventForwarder:</CODE> is that it
sets up a handler in the callback registry for the event callback.  When the
handler sees the callback, it retrieves the source of the event (which is
passed as the callback's originator) and the <CODE class="Java">EventObject</CODE>
(which is passed as the parameter), and triggers the event Symbol off
the originator.  The <CODE class="Java">EventObject</CODE> is passed as the single
argument to the event.
</P>
<P>
Please note that the event's source <EM>must</EM> be represented by a 
<A href="java-base.html#Canonical References">canonical</A> Smalltalk object,
or else the event will be triggered off a newly created reference to the
Java object each time, not from whatever one your code is observing.
</P>
<P>
The last step is to add the forwarder object to the list of listeners of
any Java objects that you are interested in.  Once it has been added (you
can and should re-use it for all the event sources) it will translate
the event from Java space into Smalltalk space.
</P>
<P>
For example, say we have references to two Java objects, both of which
generate the event <CODE class="Java">onPinged()</CODE>, which is defined
in  interface <CODE class="Java">PingListener</CODE>.  Following Java
conventions, they will both have a method <CODE class="Java">addPingListener()</CODE>
that takes an object implementing <CODE class="Java">PingListener</CODE>
and adds it to their lists of observers.
</P>
<P>
In Smalltalk we can create a
forwarder for the ping event by finding the right method:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	jvm := JVM current.
	interface := jvm findClass: #PingListener.
	event := interface abstractMethods detect:
			[:each | each name = 'onPinged'].
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
and asking it for an event forwarder:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	forwarder := event eventForwarder: #pinged:.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
We can then add the forwarder to both source objects' lists of listeners:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	source1 addPingListener_PingListener: forwarder.
	source2 addPingListener_PingListener: forwarder.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Which is enough to forward events into Smalltalk space.  However we
have to ensure that the Smalltalk events are triggered off the
right wrapper objects:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	source1 beCanonical.
	source2 beCanonical.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
before we can start observing the triggered events:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	source1
		when: #pinged:
		send: #onSource1Pinged:
		to: "... wherever ...".
	source2
		when: #pinged:
		send: #onSource2Pinged:
		to: "... wherever ...".
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
One warning: JNIPort uses the method object as the tag to identify the callback,
which means that you can't have more than one forwarder for the same event.  I can't
think of any reason why you'd need more than one forwarder (since they all do the
same thing), but if I ever do then I may remove the restriction.
