<H1>The Status Monitor's Status Page</H1>
<P>
The <DFN>Status Page</DFN> is a plug-in page for the <A href="status-monitor.html">Status
Monitor</A>.  It displays some statistics about JNIPort and provides the means to close it
down.

The statistics are updated at intervals controlled by the 'View&rArr;Update interval&rArr;'

	<TR>
		<TH>Name</TH>
		<TH>Meaning</TH>
	</TR>
</THEAD>
<TBODY>
	<TR>
		<TD>JVM name</TD>
		<TD>You can probably guess this one&hellip;</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Status</TD>
		<TD>
		Whether it's running or has been shutdown (or died by itself).
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Ghost classes</TD>
		<TD>
		Indicates whether it is configured to use <A href="ghost-classes.html">ghost
		classes</A>.  The value may be 'Lazy' or 'Eager' if ghost classes are used
		at all, otherwise will be 'NotUsed'.  'Eager' means that ghosts classes are
		generated as soon as the class is mentioned; 'Lazy' means that their creation
		is postponed until they are actually used (which improves startup time
		markedly, but is still an experimental feature in this version of JNIPort).
		This is only a rough indication because ghost classes may only be in use for
		some Java classes.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Supports callbacks</TD>
		<TD>
		Whether it has been configured to support
		<A href="callbacks.html">callbacks</A>.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Supplementary classloaders</TD>
		<!-- UPDATEME -->
		<TD>
		Whether the use of supplementary classloaders is currently enabled
		(an experimental feature in this version of JNIPort).
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Local object refs</TD>
		<TD rowspan=3>
		The number of references to Java objects currently held by JNIPort.
		The distinction between local and global is an internal matter (reflecting
		one of the odd features of <A href="jni.html">JNI</A>).  Local references
		are not used at all if JNIPort has been configured to support 
		callbacks.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Global object refs</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Total object refs</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Local pool allocated</TD>
		<TD>
		This is another internal matter related to JNI.  The local pool
		is allocated by JNI; it should be large enough for all
		all the local references held at any one time.  This
		number should never shrink, and may grow quite large if the
		finalisation process falls too far behind the allocator.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Objects created</TD>
		<TD>
		The total number of references to Java objects that
		have been wrapped as Smalltalk objects in the life of
		this runtime.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Objects released</TD>
		<TD>
		The total number of wrapper objects that have died
		and released their wrapped reference to a Java object.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Callback nesting</TD>
		<TD>
		The number of callbacks that are active at this time.  If Dolphin
		is currently servicing a callback (i.e. Smalltalk code has been called
		from Java) then this number will be at least one.  Normally it will be zero.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Registry size</TD>
		<TD>
		The size of the <A href="players.html#Class Registry">class registry</A>.
		This is just the number of Java classes and other types that JNIPort has
		ever loaded.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Index size</TD>
		<TD>
		The size of the <A href="players.html#Class Index">class index</A>.
		This is just the number of Java classes and other types that JNIPort has
		ever loaded by name (the <CODE class="Smalltalk">JVM>>findClass:</CODE>
		method).
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Callbacks</TD>
		<TD>
		The total number of callbacks that have been processed.
		This row, and the next three, will be -1 if the callback registry has not yet
		(lazily) initialised itself, and will not be displayed at all if callbacks are
		not configured.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Callback queue length</TD>
		<TD rowspan=2>
		The current and maximum length of the queue used for
		callback notifications from Java code into Smalltalk.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Callback queue max</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Callbacks registered</TD>
		<TD>
		The number of callback handlers that are registered with the callback
		registry.
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>Hook queue length</TD>
		<TD rowspan=2>
		The current and maximum length of the queue used by
		<A href="jni-helper.html">JNI Helper</A> to hold notifications
		of debugging events from the Java runtime until Dolphin is
		ready to accept them without deadlocking.  These rows are not displayed
		if JNI Helper is not configured.
