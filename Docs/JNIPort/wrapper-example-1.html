<H1>Wrapper-class Examples</H1>
<P>
This section is an example of using the generated wrapper classes.  It is equally applicable
to ghost classes or to wrappers generated using the <A href="wrapper-wizard.html">Wrapper
Wizard</A>, since they use the same <A href="method-names.html">naming scheme</A>.  The
example reads a .ZIP file using Java's zip file handling classes.
</P>
<P>
A <A href="java-base-example-1.html">parallel example</A> uses the lower-level
facilities of the base layer (package 'CU Java Base') to perform the same tasks.
</P>
<P>
One general point about this example: we use the generated wrapper methods directly
throughout, which is probably not how you would want to use them in practice.  The better
way is to define wrapper classes and provide convenient Smalltalk-style methods
that are built on top of the automatically generated ones.  However, I admit that
I quite often use the ghost methods &ldquo;raw&rdquo;, especially from workspaces.
</P>
<P>
JNIPort does not include wrappers for all the Java classes used in this example so, unless
you have generated them yourself, JNIPort should be configured to use ghost classes.
The configuration option is that the list of 'watcherClasses' under 'jniPortSettings' should
include <CODE class="Smalltalk">JVMGhostClassMaker</CODE>, there is no need to change the
'ghostClassSettings' from their defaults.  You should also have the
'CU Java Additional Wrappers' package installed, since that defines some of the
adaptors that we will use.
</P>
<P>
Ensure that a properly configured JMV is running, and open a new workspace.  We start,
as always, by getting a reference to the JVM object:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	jvm := JVM current.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Now we need to get a reference to the class static standing for the Java class,
<CODE class="Java">java.util.zip.ZipFile</CODE>:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	zfClass := jvm findClass: #'java.util.zip.ZipFile'.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Take a look at the 'Classes' page of the <A href="status-monitor.html">Status Monitor</A>
which will show what generated wrapper methods are available.  The quickest way to find
the class is to use the 'Class&rArr;Find Java Class' menu command.
It should show that there are six instance-side methods:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE class="Smalltalk">#close_null</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="Smalltalk">#entries_null</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="Smalltalk">#getEntry_String:</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="Smalltalk">#getInputStream_ZipEntry:</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="Smalltalk">#getName_null</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="Smalltalk">#size_null</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>
Three class-side methods, all of which are wrappers for constructors:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE class="Smalltalk">#new_File:</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="Smalltalk">#new_File:int:</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="Smalltalk">#new_String:</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>
And lots of getter methods for the integer constants defined by the class.
</P>
<P>
You might want to review the JavaDoc documentation for
<CODE class="Java">java.util.zip.ZipFile</CODE>.
If you have configured the JavaDoc root property of the Status Monitor
(in the 'Tools&rArr;Options' menu) then you should be able to launch a
browser directly onto the JavaDoc file by pressing F12 or selecting
'Browse JavaDoc' from the 'Class' menu.  You will have to have installed the
Java documentation for this to work; the JavaDoc root should be set to the
api/ directory under the docs/ installation folder.
</P>
<P>
Now we'll open a ZIP file.  For this example, we'll use the DolphinJNIHelper.zip file
that should be in the Metagnostic\Extras folder.  Use the file dialog to find that file:
<P>
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	zfName := FileOpenDialog showModal.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Now we create a new ZipFile object from that filename:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	zipfile := zfClass new_String: zfName.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
In this case we passed a Smalltalk String object to the ZipFile constructor that
expected a <CODE class="Java">java.lang.String</CODE> and the Smalltalk String
was converted automatically.  That conversion <EM>only</EM> works for Strings
and primitive types.
</P>
<P>
We may as well find out how many entries there are in the ZIP file:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	zipfile size_null.
		"--> 6"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Now we'll iterate over the elements of the ZipFile; we start by getting the Java
<CODE class="Java">java.util.Enumeration</CODE> iterator:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	entries := zipfile entries_null.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
The <CODE class="Smalltalk">entries</CODE> object is an instance of some Java class
that implements the <CODE class="Java">java.util.Enumeration</CODE> interface, (for
some reason, ZipFile returns a <CODE class="Java">Enumeration</CODE>
rather than the newer <CODE class="Java">Iterator</CODE>); it is actually an instance
of some inner class in ZipFile (so its class name is something like
&ldquo;java.util.zip.ZipFile$2&rdquo;).  It has the Java methods 
<CODE class="Java">hasMoreElements()</CODE> and
<CODE class="Java">nextElement()</CODE> that are guaranteed by the interface.
Since we are using ghost classes, a new ghost class will have been created for the
enumeration object, and it will have corresponding wrapper methods
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#hasMoreElements_null</CODE> and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#nextElement_null</CODE>.  So we could iterate over
the entries with a loop like:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	entries := zipfile entries_null.
	[entries hasMoreElements_null] whileTrue:
		[| next |
		next := entries nextElement_null.
		Transcript display: next; cr].
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
But that isn't very Smalltalkish.  Also it depends on the fact that we are using
ghost classes.  JNIPort comes with a better way to iterate over a
<CODE class="Java">Enumeration</CODE> (or an <CODE class="Java">Iterator</CODE>).
Sending <CODE class="Smalltalk">#asAnEnumeration</CODE> (or
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#asAnIterator</CODE>) to the
<CODE class="Smalltalk">entries</CODE> object will answer an adaptor that implements
the basics of the &lt;ReadableStream&gt; protocol.  You can then
use the common Smalltalk iteration style:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	entries := zipfile entries_null asAnEnumeration.
	[entries atEnd] whileFalse:
		[Transcript display: entries next; cr].
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
or, if you prefer:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	entries := zipfile entries_null.
	entries asAnEnumeration do:
		[:each | Transcript display: each; cr].
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
By the way, the adaptor object only implements a small part of the Smalltalk
&lt;ReadableStream&gt; protocol.  You can get a more complete implementation
by either writing the other wrapper methods yourself <I>&lt;grin&gt;</I> or by
asking for a further level of adaptor by sending
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#asReadStream</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
Another way to get a Smalltalk-style adaptor is to use
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaIteratorAdaptor</CODE> or
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaEnumerationAdaptor</CODE> (which are subclasses of
<CODE class="Smalltalk">ReadStream</CODE>), but they <EM>only</EM> work with
adaptees that use the JNIPort rules for the names of generated methods, which &mdash; in practise
&mdash; means that they only work if you are using ghost classes.
</P>
<P>
(As an aside: this mess with lots of different kinds of adaptors, some more
complete than others, is a direct consequence of Smalltalk's lack of some
form of multiple inheritance &mdash; such as mixins.  A complete
adaptor for, say, <CODE class="Smalltalk">ReadStream</CODE>, has to be
a subclass of <CODE class="Smalltalk">ReadStream</CODE> in order to pick
up all the methods of that class, including any that you've added yourself.
But I can't make my basic adaptors/proxies be subclasses of arbitrary Smalltalk
classes.  The general pattern I've followed is to duplicate the most useful
bits of the relevant Smalltalk protocol in the proxy, and provide a secondary
adaptor &mdash; which <EM>is</EM> subclassed from the &ldquo;right&rdquo;
Smalltalk class &mdash; to complete the job, if possible. It's less than ideal,
I agree.)
</P>
<P>
Now to read one of the files from inside the ZipFile.  We start by getting the
appropriate ZipEntry:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	file := 'DolphinJNIHelper/DolphinJNIHelper.h'.
	entry := zipfile getEntry_String: file.
	entry getSize_null.
		"--> 2581"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
If you check the class in the Status Monitor then you'll see that you can ask
the ZipEntry for a fair raft of data.  What you can't do is get the contents of
the file, for that you have to go back to the ZipFile (that's just the way the
Java class is designed), so: 
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	stream := zipfile getInputStream_ZipEntry: entry.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
This answers an object that is of some subclass of
<CODE class="Java">java.io.InputStream</CODE>.  Because there is a registered
wrapper class for <CODE class="Java">InputStream</CODE>, actually 
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaIoInputStream</CODE>, the <CODE class="Smalltalk">stream</CODE>
object will be an instance of some subclass of that.  The mismatch between Java's IO
design and Smalltalk's is quite bad, and I haven't been able to create a completely
Smalltalk-flavoured interface to Java streams, however you can ask the stream for
its <CODE class="Smalltalk">#upToEnd</CODE> (you can't use
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#contents</CODE> because that requires a positionable stream
and Java's streams aren't arbitrarily seekable).  Since the stream in question is
binary, the answered collection will be a <CODE class="Smalltalk">ByteArray</CODE>.
So we can get the contents of the file by saying:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	bytes := stream upToEnd.
	Transcript nextPutAll: bytes asString; flush.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
That's almost the end of the example.  We may as well clean up properly, though:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	zipfile close_null.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Finally, to see an example of what happens when Java code throws exceptions,
try getting a ZipEntry again now that the ZipFile has been closed:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	zipfile getEntry_String: 'xxx'
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Which should give a normal Smalltalk walkback.  You can trap the error in various
ways, one is:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	[zipfile getEntry_String: 'xxx']
		on: JavaException
		do: [:err | err notify].
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Another:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	exClass := jvm findClass: #'java.lang.IllegalStateException'.
	[zipfile getEntry_String: 'xxx']
		on: exClass
		do: [:err | Transcript display: 'Too bad'; cr].
</CODE></PRE>
