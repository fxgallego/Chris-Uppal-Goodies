<H1>Static Wrapper Classes</H1>
<P>
The <A href="java-base.html">basic layer</A> of JNIPort provides proxies for
Java objects and classes, the proxies allow you to invoke the underlying Java
objects' methods and to access their fields. But they are not, in themselves,
particularly easy to use.  Invoking an object's
<CODE class="Java">toString()</CODE> method, for instance, 
involves Smalltalk code like:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	aJavaObject
		callObjectMethod: 'toString'
		signature: '()Ljava/lang/String;'
		withArguments: nil.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
which is neither convenient nor readable.
</P>
<P>
The next step towards real usability is that JNIPort
allows you to specify custom <DFN>wrapper classes</DFN>.  These are subclasses
of the generic proxy classes that are associated with specific Java classes.
Whenever JNIPort creates a proxy for an instance of a Java class, it checks
to see if there is a special wrapper class registered for that case.  If there
is then it creates an instance of the custom class rather than the generic one.
JNIPort follows a similar pattern when it is creating class statics to stand for
Java classes.  You can add methods to the custom subclass that expose the Java
object's (or class's) members directly, or that build on them to create a
higher-level interface. Those methods would have to use the low-level features
like <CODE class="Smalltalk">#callObjectMethod:signature:withArguments:</CODE>
internally, but they can provide a much nicer interface to the users of the proxy.
</P>
<P>
This section is about the custom wrapper classes, and how to set them up and use them.
The <A href="wrapper-wizard.html">Wrapper Wizard</A> is able to do the grunt-work
of generating code like the call to <CODE class="Java">toString()</CODE>, above,
so this section is mostly background for understanding what it does and how to
use the results.
</P>
<P>
<strong>Please note:</strong> <em>this description has become slightly out of date.  It is still
accurate as far as it goes, but it should be updated to discuss how the new &ldquo;supplementary
classloaders&rdquo; fit into the picture.</em>
</P>
<P>
JNIPort establishes the mapping between Java classes and their designated wrappers
during the phase of initialisation called <A href="players.html#Bootstrapping">
bootstrapping</A>.  At this time, it scans the subclasses of
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaObject</CODE> looking for classes that announce themselves
to be wrappers.  A class states that it is a wrapper by answering true to
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#isWrapperClass</CODE>, which by default is implemented as
a test that the class has a class-side method (not inherited) named
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#javaClassName</CODE>.  If it does then subclasses of
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInstance</CODE> are registered as the prefered instance
wrapper class for the Java class named by <CODE class="Smalltalk">#javaClassName</CODE>,
and subclasses of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE> are registered as the
preferred class for the corresponding class static.  In fact the class static is created
at this time, and it remembers the preferred instance class.
</P>
<P>
In normal operation, all the mappings are established during bootstrapping, but
the Wrapper Wizard has the option of registering any new wrapper classes that
it builds.  Also <A href="ghost-classes.html">ghost classes</A> are created
and installed using very much the same mechanism.
</P>
<P>
When JNIPort encounters a reference to a class it has not seen before (which
can happen in many ways; e.g. when it sees a reference to an instance of
that class) it creates a class static for the class.  It decides what the
Smalltalk class of the class static will be by climbing the inheritance
ladder of the Java class until it finds a class that it already knows about
(which may turn out to be <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object</CODE>)
It then uses the same class for the new class static as it did for the
ancestor it has just found.  The effect of this is that any registered class-side
wrapper (a subclass of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE>, and in fact
of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaClassStatic</CODE>) will be used for its own
Java class and any subclasses.  For instance JNIPort uses instances of
<CODE class="Smalltalk">StaticJavaLangClassLoader</CODE> as the class statics
for the Java class <CODE class="Java">java.lang.ClassLoader</CODE>, and for all
of its subclasses.
</P>
<P>
JNIPort uses the same technique to find the right instance-side wrapper class,
so that, for example, all references to instances of
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Throwable</CODE> will be proxied by instances
of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangThrowable</CODE>.  You can, of course,
add more specialised subclasses; indeed the 'CU Java Additional Wrappers' package
does add two specialised sub-classes of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangThrowable</CODE>
that are used for instances of <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Error</CODE>
and <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Exception</CODE> and their further subclasses.
</P>
<P>
JNIPort uses class statics for Java interfaces too.  The mechanism is the
same as for normal classes, with the slight difference that, since Java interfaces
don't inherit from <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object</CODE>, the interface
wrappers are subclasses from <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInterfaceStatic</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
JNIPort can also create proxies for Java objects that are known to implement
some interface.  This case is really rather different from the normal proxies,
see <A href="java-base.html#Interface Instances">here</A> for details, but the
mechanism is very similar.  Subclasses of
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInterfaceInstance</CODE>
announce themselves to be wrappers for the Java interfaces named by their 
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#javaClassName</CODE> methods in the same way.
</P>
<P>
A convenient way to create and use wrapper classes is to start with the
methods generated by the Wrapper Wizard, and then embellish the wrapper
class with further methods that build on the generated methods, but which
have more natural names and, perhaps, a higher-level of functionality than
is provided by the Java class itself.  (As an aside: Java classes tend to
have very narrow interfaces, sometimes to the point of anorexia.)
</P>
<P>
As an example of this, the package 'CU Java Additional Wrappers' contains
instance wrapper classes for <CODE class="Java">java.io.OutputStream</CODE>
and <CODE class="Java">java.io.Writer</CODE>.  The wrapper classes were
both generated by the Wrapper Wizard, and so they have methods with names like
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#write_charArray:int:int:</CODE> and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#write_byteArray:int:int:</CODE> which simply forward
to the corresponding Java methods.  The methods are named by following
JNIPort's mechanical <A href="method-names.html">rules</A> for the names of the
generated methods.  The names are not very Smalltalk-ish, and the interpretation
of the Integer parameters follows Java's 0-based indexing convention.  Therefore
the Additional Wrappers package embellishes the raw Java methods with Smalltalk
methods like <CODE class="Smalltalk">#writeChars:from:to:</CODE>, which follow
the normal Smalltalk conventions, and <CODE class="Smalltalk">#nextPutAll:</CODE>
which allow the proxies to understand the Smalltalk output stream protocols.
</P>
<P>
One important point about this particular example is that most of the embellishments
are implemented in a common superclass for the two wrapper classes.
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaIoOutputStream</CODE> and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaIoWriter</CODE> both inherit from
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaWriteStream</CODE>, which is where methods like
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#cr</CODE> and <CODE class="Smalltalk">#space</CODE>
are implemented.  <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaWriteStream</CODE> is not itself
a wrapper class, but it collects some useful commonality between the two Java
classes, even though they are not related in the Java hierarchy. JNIPort
contains several such cases where &ldquo;informal&rdquo; similarities between
Java classes are exploited as subclass relationships within the hierarchy of
wrapper classes.
</P>
<P>
One last point is about ghost classes.  JNIPort generates and populates ghost classes
on the fly.  When it generates a ghost class, it always ensures that the ghost inherits
from the most applicable custom wrapper class, which means that it will also understand
any embellishments that are defined by the wrapper class.  For instance, in the case
of a <CODE class="Java">java.Io.Writer</CODE>, the proxy will be an instance of a
dynamically-generated subclass of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaIoWriter</CODE>, and
so will understand <CODE class="Smalltalk">#nextPutAll:</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
The Wrapper Wizard generates methods with the same names and meanings as the
ghost classes have, but the ghost implementation is faster.  So, when a ghost
is derived from a class that was initially populated by the Wrapper Wizard, the
ghost methods will override the Wizard-generated methods with faster versions.
Because <CODE class="Smalltalk">#nextPutAll:</CODE> is implemented on top of the
methods that the Wrapper Wizard-generated (rather than calling the methods of
'Java Base' directly) it will pick up the faster implementation if ghosts are in use.
