<H1>JNIPort and JVMs</H1>
<P>
This section is about which JVMs JNIPort has been tested against.
I have tried <EM>no</EM> other JVMs at all.</P>
<P>
Each JVM implementation comes with its own way of locating the runtime (since Sun didn't even
bother to set up a decent convention, let alone a proper specification, for how to do this).
The corresponding subclasses of JNILibrary differ only in that they understand the different
vendors' conventions.  If you explicitly specify the location of the JVM DLL in the
configuration, then the conventions are ignored and there is no effective difference
between the versions of JNILibrary.
</P>
<P>
If you try another JVM implementation then please do let me know how you get on.  Note that
JNIPort requires an implementation of JNI that is compatible with (at least) the 1.2.x release
from Sun.
</P>
<H2>Sun JVMs</H2>
<P>
I've used the Sun JVMs almost exclusively as I've been writing JNIPort.  It really requires a
1.4.x version of the JVM to work fully.  The 1.3.x series also worked when I last used them,
but there were a few bugs.  I can't remember exactly what; I think there were some problems with
accessing static fields inherited from interfaces.  Also the -verbose:jni option caused the
JVM to issue <EM>thousands</EM> of warnings about exceeding the capacity of the local pool
(the warnings were wrong, but irritating nonetheless).  A very early version of JNIPort was
based on 1.2.x, but there were endless problems and instabilities &mdash; the problems
were mostly with Sun's code (their floating-point handling), but it <EM>might</EM> be
that current JNIPort, and a recent Dolphin VM, could be made to work with it.
</P>
<P>
The Sun JVM's have always had a problem with floating point exceptions.  The picture has
improved over time, partly because Sun have worked on the problems, but also because, since
version 5, Dolphin now suppresses floating point underflow errors by default (it was always
intended to, but the default was set wrongly).  The Sun JVM seems to require that both
underflow and overflow exceptions are turned off or else it fails <EM>intermittently</EM>
on floating point operations that generate the error.  To turn off overflow trapping, execute
this Dolphin code:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	active := Processor activeProcess.
	fpeMask := active fpeMask: (active fpeMask | _EM_OVERFLOW).
	...some code which might overflow...
	active fpeMask: fpeMask.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
The constant, <CODE class="Smalltalk">_EM_OVERFLOW</CODE>, is defined in the pool constants
dictionary <CODE class="Smalltalk">CRTConstants</CODE>.
</P>
<H2>IBM JVMs</H2>
<P>
I've tested briefly against the IBM JVM for Windows.  It seems to work OK.  There are
a couple of bugs in the JVM that show up in the regression tests, but these are because of
a really obscure part of the JVM semantics that IBM have got wrong.  It shouldn't
affect anything in practice.  The most recent IBM version that I've tried is 1.3.x, so there
may be a later version with the bug fixed.  Since the IBM implementation for Windows seems
to be based on Sun's code, it shares the same irritating tendency to witter on about the
local pool.
</P>
<P>
I haven't tested extensively, but it appears that the IBM JVM does not share Sun's problems
with floating point exceptions.
</P>
<H2>BEA JVMs (JRockit)</H2>
<P>
I've tested briefly against version 7 of the JRockit JVM from BEA Weblogic.  It <EM>almost</EM>
works, but there is a nasty bug in their implementation of
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class.declaredMethods()</CODE> (and similar) when called directly
from JNI.  JNIPort includes a patch in package 'CU JRockit Patch' &mdash; see the package comment
for how to install it (loading the package does not automatically install the patch). BEA
released version 8 of JRockit recently, but I haven't had time to try it, so I don't know
whether they've fixed the bug, they hadn't in the beta of version 8.
</P>
<P>
With the patch, the picture is very much the same as with IBM.  There are a couple of obscure
bugs and incompatibilities with Sun's JVM, but nothing very major.
</P>
<P>
The BEA JVM appears to suffer from the same floating point failures as Sun's.  Only worse &mdash;
the failure crashes Dolphin rather than simply aborting the Java runtime.
