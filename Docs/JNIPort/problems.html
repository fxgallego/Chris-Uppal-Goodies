<H1>JNIPort Problems and Limitations</H1>
<P>
This section contains some notes on what I see as the weaknesses of JNIPort.
</P>

<HR>
<H2>Stability issues</H2>
<P>
JNIPort is based on the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Java runtime. That has great advantages in terms of
performance and compatibility.  It brings corresponding disadvantages in the way that the
Dolphin session is exposed to the whims and derelictions of the implementers of the Java
runtime &mdash; which is, after all, just a DLL.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that means that using JNIPort can crash a Dolphin image.  Using the Sun
JVMs, the problem has grown smaller and smaller with each successive release, but there still
are very occasional crashes:
</P>
<UL>

<LI><P>
The biggest problem is, and probably always will be, <CODE class="Java">java.lang.System.exit()</CODE>.
There are only three ways to deal with Java code that calls this pernicious method:
</P>

<OL>
<LI><P>
Do nothing; just hope that nothing will call <CODE class="Java">exit()</CODE>.  If it does then
the Dolphin session will also exit.  You have no chance to save data.
Actually this approach does work fairly well in practice, but is obviously not a perfect solution.
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
Use the JNI exit &ldquo;hook&rdquo; to trap and ignore attempts to <CODE class="Java">exit()</CODE>.
This ought to work, but does not &mdash; at least not with any implementation I've yet tried.
Sun's JVMs up to 1.4.0 used to deadlock if you provided an exit hook that didn't exit.  1.4.1
has improved the picture slightly, and it now hits an internal breakpoint (see below) instead.
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
Use Java's internal security policies to forbid all calls to <CODE class="Java">exit()</CODE>;
that might work, but I haven't tried it yet.
</P></LI>
</OL>
<P>
Or, I suppose, one could take a sharp stick and go &ldquo;reason&rdquo; with the code's author.
</P>
</LI>

<LI><P>
The programmers at Sun tend to forget that their Java runtime may only be a part of a bigger
application; they leave breakpoints in the code rather than returning errors.
I presume that their reasoning is that the JVM is no longer in a trustworthy
state, so it's best just to exit.  They don't consider the possibility that
the <EM>rest</EM> of the application might be able to continue, at least
enough to allow you to save data, etc.
</P>
<P>
The symptom is that you get a Windows error message telling you that a breakpoint has been
reached, and giving you the option of killing the process (the default) or debugging it.
I have <EM>sometimes</EM> been able to continue for a little while by letting the system
start the debugger (MS VC++ in my case) and using it to &ldquo;continue&rdquo; the application.
The Dolphin IDE's in a decidedly unstable state by that point, though, so it's better not to
do more than save any work, and perhaps do a little debugging to see how the breakpoint was
triggered.
</P></LI>

<LI><P>
Any complex code can have problems; the Sun JVMs have a history of problems with floating point
handling, for instance.  Since Dolphin and the Java DLL are sharing a process space, Dolphin is
exposed to any bugs in the Java VM's implementation.  In general the latest JVMs seem
pretty stable, but I still see crashes every couple of months or so.  Usually they don't
kill Dolphin, but that can happen too.
</P>
<P>
</P></LI>
</UL>

<P>
See the notes on individual <A href="jvms.html">JVMs</A> for other information about
specific problems with individual vendor's products.
</P>

<P>
Most current Java VMs for Windows use operating-system threads.  (They may multiplex more
than one Java thread onto an OS thread, but that doesn't affect this issue, except possibly
to make it worse).  Dolphin executes all Smalltalk code on just one OS thread.  This mismatch of
models is described in <A href="threading.html">the problem with threads</A>.  It causes a
number of problems, most significantly it means that I've had to use some very slow and
restricting workarounds to allow any callbacks from Java to Smalltalk at all.  Even with the
workarounds, it is possible to create situations that deadlock.  They can be avoided by taking
sufficient care, but it's difficult to get right (even more difficult than avoiding deadlocks
in normal threaded code, which is challenging enough in itself).  The simple solution is not
to use callbacks and Java threads together.
</P>

<P>
One last point under this heading: I am not IBM (or Sun, or Microsoft), I do not have the
resources for extensive testing.  But JNIPort is a fairly large piece of software;
if I'd tested to the extent that I'd wish (either out of a programmer's natural desire
to do a good job, or in my other role as a user of JNIPort) then it'd still be <EM>ages</EM>
away from first release.
</P>

<HR>
<H2>Performance issues</H2>
<!-- UPDATEME -->
<P>
I think the biggest <EM>curable</EM> issue with JNIPort performance is that creating
ghost classes can be very slow.  This isn't so much because it takes a long time to
create a ghost class, but because creating a ghost for one class means that all other
classes that it refers to (method parameters, and so on) also get imported.  Since these
other classes also have ghost classes created for them, the process only stops when the
transitive closure of the inter-class references have all been loaded.  In theory that
could load every class on the planet.  In practice, the worst case I've seen is Swing, where
referring to any one class is likely to drag in a large fraction of Swing &mdash; several
hundred classes.  Switching to a less eager scheme for creating ghost classes is my single
highest priority for the future of JNIPort.  <strong>Stop press:</strong> <em>actually that is
available now, if you use a <CODE class="Smalltalk">JVMLazyGhostClassMaker</CODE> instead of
an <CODE class="Smalltalk">JVMGhostClassMaker</CODE> &mdash; the feature is still experimental,
though.</em>
</P>
<P>
Callbacks from Java into Smalltalk could never be very convenient, since the JNI model is
that all callbacks are implementations of &ldquo;native&rdquo; methods (so there is no
instance-specific behaviour, and no natural equivalent of a function pointer).  However,
because the <A href="threading.html">the problem with threads</A>, JNIPort can't even make
full use of that (basically because it can't pass any object references across the interface
from Java up into Smalltalk).  Therefore JNIPort includes a workaround that allows Java code
to construct and enqueue &ldquo;request&rdquo; objects that hold the parameters and return
value of a callback.  The only data that passes from Java to Smalltalk is a notification that the
queue of requests is not empty, the rest of the process of serving the requests is driven
from Dolphin (calling down into Java).  This works but is not convenient for the programmer;
nor is it quick.  In fact it is very slow: in the <EM>millisecond</EM> range and up, which
is too slow for many applications. Currently, I have no ideas at all about how this could
be improved.
</P>
<P>
Whenever a new reference to a Java object enters the JNIPort system, it must generate a wrapper
object.  The lookups involved in finding the right classes mean that the performance is
less than stellar.  Wrapping a reference takes (depending on the machine, and what optimisations
JNIPort can use) 10 to 100 microseconds &mdash; which is quite a long time by computer standards.
It <EM>might</EM> be possible to use some sort of lazy wrapping scheme to reduce the overhead,
or perhaps some kind of cache, but I haven't investigated either the feasibility or the potential
benefits yet.  I don't see this as high priority.
</P>

<HR>
<H2>Functional issues</H2>
<P>
Probably the single most irritating thing about JNIPort (in a development context) is that you
can't either run different Java runtimes at the same time, or stop the current one and start a
new one.  This comes down to Sun's failure to implement their own published APIs (though all the
other JVMs I've tested have the same failings).  There's nothing that can be done about it; if
you want to start a new Java runtime, then you have to quit and restart Dolphin (fortunately,
that's a fast operation).
</P>
<!-- UPDATEME -->
<P>
Currently there is no way to unload a reference to a Java class. Once JNIPort has seen a reference
to it (say because it's seen an instance of a subclass) it will hold onto that reference until the
Java runtime is shut down.  This prevents the class being garbage collected by Java. The issue
may be trivial for some potential applications of JNIPort, but it directly affects my own work, so
it's high on the list of things to fix.  <strong>Stop press:</strong> <em>actually that is available
now, if you use a &ldquo;supplementary classloader&rdquo; &mdash; the feature is still experimental,
though.</em>
</P>
<P>
The methods in category 'documentation' on the class-side of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JVM</CODE>
contain some more notes about bugs and deficiencies in the current version of JNIPort.
</P>
<P>
I you happen to think that the new &ldquo;generics&rdquo; in Java are a good idea (I most
certainly do not) then you may be disappointed to find that JNIPort doesn't support them.  In
fact it <em>can't</em>, because generics are a fiction created entirely as a gross hack in the
Java compiler, and are not seen by the Java runtime at all.  Since JNIPort talks to the Java
runtime, and has nothing whatever to do with the Java compiler, it can only see and manipulate
the <em>real</em> classes, objects, and methods.
</P>

<HR>
<H2>Other issues</H2>
<P>
OK, yes, I admit it. The documentation's not complete.  It probably never will be.  Live with it.
</P>
<P>
The documentation doesn't have enough structure to the cross-links either, I do intend to fix
that.
</P>
<P>
JNIPort lives in a large number of Dolphin packages.  It depends on a rather large number of
further packages of code I've written.  Most of them are marked &ldquo;unpublished&rdquo; (see
<A href="../Prerequisites.html">here</A> for an explanation of what I mean by that).  So it
brings a lot of baggage with it.  There's very little I can do about that: I can't move the
code from the prerequisite packages into JNIPort because other of my stuff depends on it
(and not on JNIPort), and anyway that would just hide the problem.  I don't have a good
solution, or I'd be using it.  I'm afraid it's just the practical downside of code reuse&hellip;
