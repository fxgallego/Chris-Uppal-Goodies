<H1>The Wrapper Wizard</H1>
<P>
The <DFN>Wrapper Wizard</DFN> is a GUI tool to help create <A href="wrapper-classes.html">
wrapper classes</A>.
</P>
<P>
It understands the conventions that JNIPort uses for such classes, and knows how to
use Java reflection to generate forwarding methods and accessors for Java members.
</P>
<HR>
<P>
The tool is launched from the <A href="status-monitor-classes.html">classes page</A> of
the <A href="status-monitor.html">Status Monitor</A>.  Select the target Java class
or interface from the class tree (if the class is not already loaded then you can
use the 'Find/Load Java class' command from the class menu).  From here you can elect
to generate instance-side or class-side wrapper methods:
</P>
<P>
<IMG src="wrapper-wizard-0.gif" alt="Selecting Wrapper Wizard from class page's menu">
</P>
<HR>
<P>
The wizard has three stages.  In the first you select the target class to which the
wrapper methods will be added.  This should be a subclass of
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangObject</CODE> if you are wrapping the instance-side of
a Java class or a subclass of <CODE class="Smalltalk">StaticJavaLangObject</CODE> for
the class side.  If you are creating wrappers for an interface then you should be
subclassing either <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInterfaceInstance</CODE> or
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInterfaceStatic</CODE> respectively.  The Wizard will
attempt to find the &ldquo;best&rdquo; Smalltalk class to start with, but unless
you are re-generating the wrappers of an already wrapped class, then you will need
to create a new subclass of it.  You can create the class, if you wish, from the
context menu of the class selector pane, or by using the 'New&hellip;' button.
 The 'Next' button is not enabled unless you have selected a suitable target
class that either already wraps the Java class, or which has not yet been declared to
be a wrapper class.
</P>
<P>
<IMG src="wrapper-wizard-1.gif" alt="Selecting target class in Wrapper Wizard">
</P>
<P>
In this image, we are about to generate instance-side wrapper methods for the Java class
<CODE class="Java">java.net.URL</CODE>, and add them to the Smalltalk class 
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaNetURL</CODE>.
</P>
<HR>
<P>
In stage 2 you select which of the Java class's members will be exposed via wrappers.
By default wrappers are generated for all the public methods, fields, and constructors.
</P>
<P>
<IMG src="wrapper-wizard-2.gif" alt="Selecting members to wrap in Wrapper Wizard">
</P>
<P>
In this image, we have not changed the default.  The tabs at the bottom of the page list the
members for which wrappers will be generated given the current settings.  In this case
the 'Constructors' tab is available, even though we are generating instance-side methods;
that is a harmless deficiency in the tool's user-interface that I'll quite probably never
bother to fix.  The 'Others' tab shows the additional &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; methods that
the Wizard will generate in order to allow JNIPort to recognise that the target class is
to be used as a wrapper.
</P>
<HR>
<P>
The final page shows a list of all the methods that are to be generated.  I intend that
a later version will allow you to &ldquo;fine-tune&rdquo; the selection at this point,
but the current version does not have that capability.
</P>
<P>
<IMG src="wrapper-wizard-3.gif" alt="Confirming generated methods in Wrapper Wizard">
</P>
<P>
This image shows all the methods that will be generated.  Note that the housekeeping
methods will be added to the class side of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaNetURL</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
It is not illustrated here, but if any of the proposed methods would overwrite an existing
method, then the first column will show a warning symbol.  If the pre-existing method
was is the '**auto generated**' category, then that would just be a warning (the Wizard
puts all its generated methods into that category, so it assumes that it's OK to overwrite
methods that it has generated itself).  If the method is not in that category then the Wizard
will show an error icon, and will not overwrite it.
</P>
<P>
The tick box selects whether the new wrapper class should be registered with the current
class registry.  If so then it will be used for the rest of the session, otherwise it will
not take effect until you re-start JNIPort.  This option will be disabled if you are using
ghost-classes or if the class is already registered.
</P>
<P>
If you click 'Finish' then the methods will be added to the target class.  A popup will
confirm that the action is complete.  If there were any errors (say, because there was
a pre-existing method that should not be overwritten) then the popup will say so, and
a longer description will be written to the transcript.
