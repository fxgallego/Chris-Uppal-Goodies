<H1>JNIPort Overview</H1>
<P>
<DFN>JNIPort</DFN> is my name for a collection of packages that allow Java code to be
invoked from Dolphin Smalltalk.
</P>
<P>
The implementation builds on the Java &ldquo;native&rdquo; interface (called JNI),
and then provides the superstructure to let you to manipulate Java objects pretty
much as if they were Smalltalk objects.  The main advantages of this are:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>
		You can supplement Smalltalk's libraries with the rather extensive
		Java libraries from Sun and other vendors.
	</P></LI>
	<LI><P>
		You can use the normal, interactive, way of playing with objects and code in
		workspaces to learn about and prototype Java operations.  JNIPort lets
		you <EM>talk</EM> to your Java objects, just as you can to Smalltalk
		objects, rather leaving them hidden away behind a dead wall of syntax
		compounded by the edit-compile-run fallacy.
	</P></LI>
	<LI><P>
		<EM>And, of course</EM>, you don't have to abandon your legacy Java code
		when you migrate to a more grown-up language&hellip;
	</P></LI>
</UL>
<P>
However, please do read the section on the <A href="problems.html">problems and limitations</A>
of JNIPort.
</P>
<P>
JNIPort works by talking to a &ldquo;real&rdquo; running JVM, rather than by executing
the Java bytecodes in the Smalltalk VM (which, as I understand it, is how the
<A href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/VisualWorks/Frost" target=_blank>Frost</A> project,
and
<A href="http://www.exept.de/sites/exept/english/Smalltalk/frame_uebersicht.html" target=_blank>Smalltalk-X</A>
do it).
This approach has both advantages and disadvantages.  One of the big advantages is that
JNIPort is always complete and up to date with the latest Java version.  One downside is
that the performance advantages of running Java bytecodes on a high-performance JVM can
be lost in the overhead of crossing the &ldquo;boundary&rdquo; between the Smalltalk VM
and the Java VM.  A bigger disadvantage is that JNIPort is very exposed to the the JVM,
which is just a DLL sharing the same process space as Dolphin.  Any peculiarities of the
way it does things can affect Dolphin; for instance calling java.lang.System.exit() will
duly cause your Dolphin session to exit!  (So don't do that.)
</P>
<P>
JNIPort comes with a fair amount of documentation.  It is not intended to be exhaustive,
but is just to help you get oriented with the system.  It's less well structured than I would
like, but good places to start might be:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>
If you like to start with hands-on examples, then try looking at the <A href="walkthrough.html">
walkthrough</A> of installing JNIPort, and this <A href="wrapper-example-1.html">example</A>
of using it to read a ZIP file.
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
If you prefer to start with the concepts, then there are three different views of how the
system fits together.  A description of the <A href="layers.html">layers</A> of JNIPort;
a description of the main <A href="players.html">players</A> in the community of JNIPort objects
and how they interact; and a description of the <A href="java-base.html">features</A> of
JNIPort and how to use it.
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
If you are going to use ghost classes (which is the highest level of JNIPort and the
most convenient to use) then you should probably take at least a quick look at the
<A href="ghost-classes.html">Ghost Classes</A> section.
</P></LI>
</UL>
<P>
A complete list of the JNIPort documentation is <A href="index.html">here</A>, and
a few more examples are listed <A href="examples.html">here</A>.
</P>
<P>
The rest of this overview is a very short example of using JNIPort with ghost classes.
</P>
<HR>
<P>
First we need a connection to the JVM, there are various ways of configuring and starting these,
but here we'll just assume that one is running already.
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	jvm := JVM current.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
The JVM instance is the central point of JNIPort.  It is responsible for starting up and
shutting down the Java DLL, it also acts as the switchboard through which the various objects
in the system can find each other.  In particular it is where you go to find a handle on a
Java class.
</P>
<P>
Each Java class is represented by a unique <DFN>class static</DFN>.  These objects have methods
corresponding to the class side (&ldquo;static&rdquo;) members of the Java class; they also
have methods corresponding to the Java classes' constructors.
<P>
We'll start with <CODE class="Java">java.lang.System</CODE> since that's a well known class
with some interesting (well, -ish) static methods:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	class := jvm findClass: #'java.lang.System'.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
That has looked for, and possibly created, the class static that stands for
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.System</CODE>.
Now for a couple of method calls, first we get the current time (in milliseconds):
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	class currentTimeMillis_null.
		"--> 1045217556089"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
which is equivalent to the Java code:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Java">	java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis();
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
only, of course, you are invoking it in a interactive workspace &mdash; which you can't
do normally in Java.  What has actually happened is that
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#currentTimeMillis_null</CODE> invoked a <DFN>ghost method</DFN>, which
is a dynamically-generated method that uses the JNI APIs to forward the call to the
underlying Java method. The <CODE class="Smalltalk">class</CODE> object is actually
an instance of an ephemeral class that was generated by JNIPort to hold the forwarding methods
(I call these ephemeral classes <DFN>ghost classes</DFN>).  You don't have to use
ghost classes to use JNIPort, but they are convenient.
</P>
<P>
Now we'll call a method with a parameter:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	string := class getProperty_String: 'java.vm.vendor'.
		"--> a java.lang.String(Sun Microsystems Inc.)"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
This time we called a method that takes a String argument (automatically converted from
a Smalltalk String) and answers an instance of <CODE class="Java">java.lang.String</CODE>.
If we wanted to convert the answer into a proper Smalltalk string then we'd send it
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#asString</CODE>, but for now we'll leave it as a Java object.
</P>
<P>
We can send it messages corresponding to the Java methods in
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.String</CODE>, e.g:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	string substring_int: 3 int: 7.
		"--> a java.lang.String( Mic)"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Notice the way we pass multiple integer parameters.  Again this is using one of
the automatically generated wrapper methods; you are not limited to using the
generated methods, you can also set up normal Smalltalk methods.  JNIPort already
comes with quite a lot of helper methods to give Java Strings (and other aggregates
like arrays) a Smalltalk face.  For instance Smalltalk-style iteration:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	string do: [:each | Transcript print: each; space].
	Transcript cr.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
which will write <CODE class="Smalltalk">$S $u $n $  $M $i $c $r $o $s $y $s $t $e
$m $s $  $I $n $c $. </CODE> to the Transcript.
</P>
<P>
JNIPort knows how to assign Java instances to the correct wrapper class. In the
case of strings, JNIPort includes a class (called, imaginatively enough,
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangString</CODE>) and this is where Smalltalk methods like
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#do:</CODE> are defined.
In this example we're using ghost classes, so the real class of our
<CODE class="Smalltalk">string</CODE> object is a dynamically generated subclass of 
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangString</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
We can ask the <CODE class="Smalltalk">string</CODE> for its Smalltalk class:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	string isKindOf: JavaLangString.
		"--> true"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Or we can ask it for its class static.
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	class := string static.
		"--> a java.lang.String.static(java.lang.String)"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
The class static, remember, represents the Java class.  Class statics are unique, so:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	(jvm findClass: #'java.lang.String') == class.
		"--> true"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
The class static is where the constructors live, so we can create a new string, in
this case an empty string:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	class new_null.
		"--> a java.lang.String()"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Or a copy of our original one:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	class new_String: string.
		"--> a java.lang.String(Sun Microsystems Inc.)"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Or a copy of a Smalltalk string:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	class new_String: 'Hello!'.
		"--> a java.lang.String(Hello!)"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
There's lots more to tell, but I want to keep this example short.  See the rest of the JNIPort
<A href="index.html">documentation</A> for details.
