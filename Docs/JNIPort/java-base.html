<H1>Basic JNIPort</H1>
<P>
The basic level of JNIPort, in package 'CU Java Base', uses the raw JNI functions
exposed via package 'CU JNI' and builds a framework for manipulating Java objects
and classes via Smalltalk proxies.
</P>
<P>
The proxies for Java objects don't have a special name in JNIPort, I tend to refer
to them as <DFN>[instance] wrappers</DFN>, or occasionally as <DFN>proxies</DFN>.
They are instances of subclasses of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInstance</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
The &ldquo;proxies&rdquo; for Java classes are called <DFN>class statics</DFN>;
of course they aren't really proxies, in the normal sense of the word, because there
is no object in Java that they are a proxy <EM>for</EM>.  Still, they provide an
Facade that exposes the static members of Java classes as if they were attached to
some object (which, in fact, they probably are &mdash; hidden away inside the Java
runtime somewhere).  They are instances of subclasses of
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
For more information on instance wrappers and class statics, see the description
of the main <A href="players.html">players</A> of JNIPort.
</P>
<P>
For an example of using this level of JNIPort, see <A href="java-base-example-1.html">
here
</A>.

<P>
<IMG

	alt="Class Hierarchy highlighting JavaObject">
</P>
<P>
All JNIPort proxies, both for the class- and instance-sides, are subclassed
from <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaObject</CODE>.  This class provides a uniform
framework for calling methods, and accessing Java fields, (collectively
called the &ldquo;members&rdquo;) of a Java class.
</P>
<P>
All these objects are owned by a single <DFN>JVM</DFN> object, which stands for the
Java runtime.  Instances respond to the <CODE class="Smalltalk">#jvm</CODE> message
that, unsurprisingly, answers that object.  The JVM object has some
<A href="setup.html">configuration</A> options that determine, for instance, which
Java runtime it will start, and what options it will pass to that runtime.  The
JVM object's role is also described in the <A href="players.html">Players</A> section.
</P>
<P>
Instances obviously depend on the Java runtime; as long as the runtime is, er, running
they are considered to be &ldquo;live&rdquo;; after the runtime has shut down, any
surviving instances will be &ldquo;dead&rdquo; (as will their owning JVM).  When you
save and restart the image, the Java runtime is not restarted, and so all the
Smalltalk objects that referred to it become dead.  The simplest way to configure and
start/stop Java runtimes is via the GUI tool, the <A href="status-monitor.html">Status
Monitor</A>.
</P>
<P>
The remainder of this sub-section discusses the common features of all 
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaObjects</CODE>.
</P>

<H3>Reading and Writing Java Fields</H3>
<P><I>
You can safely skip this sub-section if you are using <A href="ghost-classes.html">ghost classes</A>
or the <A href="wrapper-wizard.html">Wrapper Wizard</A>.
</I></P>
<P>
Unfortunately, due to the way that Java/JNI work, you have to use different methods to
access a Java field depending on its type.  There are specific methods for each of Java's
primitive types, and another for use when it holds object references.
</P>
<P>
The 'Java field access' method category of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaObject</CODE> contains
methods for reading or writing the value of a field that holds a primitive type.  A slew
of &ldquo;getter&rdquo; methods like, 
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#getBooleanField:</CODE>, <CODE class="Smalltalk">#getByteField:</CODE>,
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#getIntField:</CODE>, and so on, read a field which holds one of
Java's primitive types.
Then another slew of &ldquo;setters&rdquo;, <CODE class="Smalltalk">#getBooleanField:to:</CODE>, etc,
write to the field.
The values are represented by the corresponding Smalltalk types
according to the rules <A href="#Passing Primitive Types">below</A>.
</P>
<P>
When you access a reference field in a Java object (or class), you must supply both the
name of the field, and its <DFN>signature</DFN>.  The signature of a field is a string that
describes its statically-declared type.  Signatures are described more fully 
<A href="jni-names.html#Signatures">here</A>, but, for example, the signature of a
field that is defined as:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Java">	String	m_String;
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
is 'Ljava/lang/String;'.
</P>
<P>
You can read the value of a field that holds an object reference with the
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaObject>>getObjectField:signature:</CODE> method.  For instance,
to read the <CODE class="Java">m_String</CODE> field of some object, the Smalltalk code
would be:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	aProxy
		getObjectField: 'm_field'
		signature: 'Ljava/lang/String;'
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
The 'Java field access' method category of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaObject</CODE> contains
a couple of convenience methods for use in cases where you know that the field is
declared to hold a <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object</CODE> or a
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.String</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
Since our field does hold a string, we could recode the example as:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	aProxy getStringField: 'm_field'
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Please note that the value of either expression would be a Smalltalk object wrapping an
instance of <CODE class="Java">java.lang.String</CODE>, <EM>not</EM> a Smalltalk
<CODE class="Smalltalk">String</CODE>.  (You can convert it with
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#asString</CODE>.)
</P>
<P>
You can change the value of a reference field with the
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaObject>>setObjectField:signature:to:</CODE> method.  For instance,
to set the <CODE class="Java">m_String</CODE> field to some pre-existing Java string,
the Smalltalk code would be:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	aJavaString := ...
	aProxy
		setObjectField: 'm_field'
		signature: 'Ljava/lang/String;'
		to: aJavaString.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Again, there are a few convenience methods for handling the commonest classes. In this
case we could have written:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	aJavaString := ...
	aProxy
		setStringField: 'm_field'
		to: aJavaString.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
And, in fact, that particular method knows how to convert Smalltalk strings into Java
strings, where necessary.  So we could also have written:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	aProxy
		setStringField: 'm_field'
		to: 'JNIPort!!'.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Other than that one automatic conversion, any the value read from, or written to, a reference
field must either be a reference to a Java object, or must be
<CODE class="Smalltalk">nil</CODE>, which stands for Java's <CODE class="Java">null</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
A warning (or possibly it's an opportunity): since JNIPort works via JNI, the normal
Java protection mechanisms are simply ignored.  That means that you can read/write
&ldquo;private&ldquo; fields as easily as &ldquo;public&ldquo; ones.  You can also
change the value of &ldquo;final&ldquo; fields.  Changing the value of a
&ldquo;static final int&ldquo; field in an interface may seem fun, but it probably
isn't a very good idea&hellip;
</P>

<H3>Calling Java Methods</H3>
<P><I>
You can safely skip this sub-section if you are using ghost classes or the Wrapper
Wizard.
</I></P>
<P>
When you call a method of a Java object (or class), you must supply both the name of the
method, and its signature.  The signature of a method is a string that describes
its argument types and return type. Signatures are described
<A href="jni-names.html#Signatures">here</A>, but, for example, the signature of a
method that is defined as:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Java">	String	toString(Double fuzz) { ... };
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
is '(D)Ljava/lang/String;'.  
</P>
<P>
As with reading the value of a field, there are a number of different ways
of invoking a Java method, and which you use depends on the Java method's
return type.  The methods are in the 'Java method calls' category of
class <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaObject</CODE>.  They have names,
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#callBooleanMethod:signature:withArguments:</CODE>,
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#callByteMethod:signature:withArguments:</CODE>, and
so on through all the Java primitive types (including <CODE class="Java">void</CODE>),
plus <CODE class="Smalltalk">#callObjectMethod:signature:withArguments:</CODE>,
which is used for any method that returns an object reference.
</P>
<P>
If the method takes no parameters then the signature is determined completely
by the return type.  There are a number of convenience methods that help with
this special case; for instance <CODE class="Smalltalk">#callByteMethod:</CODE>
which &ldquo;knows&rdquo; that the named method takes no arguments and so that
the signature must by '()B'.
</P>
<P>
If the method does take parameters, then you must supply a signature yourself.  You
must also build up a <CODE class="Smalltalk">JNIValueArray</CODE>
to hold the parameters you want to pass to the call.  A <CODE class="Smalltalk">JNIValueArray</CODE>
is an array-like object that holds a list of arguments; you create one of the appropriate
size, and then fill in each argument with typed versions of <CODE class="Smalltalk">#at:put:</CODE>
before passing it to the Java method. For instance, given a reference to a Java string,
this code will invoke its <CODE class="Java">substring(int, int)</CODE> method:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	jString := ...
	args := (JNIValueArray new: 2)
			intAt: 1 put: 5;
			intAt: 2 put: 10;
			yourself.
	subString := jString
			callObjectMethod: 'substring'
			signature: '(II)Ljava/lang/String;'
			withArguments: args.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Primitive types are added to the list with <CODE class="Smalltalk">#booleanAtPut:</CODE>,
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#byteAtPut:</CODE>, and so on.  The values are represented by the
corresponding Smalltalk types according to the rules <A href="#Passing Primitive Types">below</A>.
Object references are added with <CODE class="Smalltalk">#objectAtPut:</CODE>, and must either
be a reference to a Java object, or <CODE class="Smalltalk">nil</CODE>.
There are many examples of using <CODE class="Smalltalk">JNIValueArrays</CODE> in JNIPort, browse
for references to the class.
</P>
<P>
A warning: <CODE class="Smalltalk">JNIValueArray</CODE> is a kind of
<CODE class="Smalltalk">ExternalStructure</CODE> and <EM>does not protect references from 
the garbage collector</EM>.
For instance, if you are passing a temporary Java string to a method, then you
<STRONG>must not</STRONG> code it like this:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	args := (JNIValueArray new: 1)
			objectAt: 1 put: ('test' asJavaString: jvm);
			yourself.
	subString := jString
			callObjectMethod: 'setName'
			signature: '(Ljava/lang/String;)V'
			withArguments: args.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
because the temporary Java string, created by <CODE class="Smalltalk">('test' asJavaString: jvm)</CODE>,
would quite probably be garbage collected before it could be used.  You have to ensure that there
is a separate reference to any object stored in a <CODE class="Smalltalk">JNIValueArray</CODE>.
For instance:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	tmpString := 'test' asJavaString: jvm.
	args := (JNIValueArray new: 1)
			objectAt: 1 put: tmpString;
			yourself.
	subString := jString
			callObjectMethod: 'setName'
			signature: '(Ljava/lang/String;)V'
			withArguments: args.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Another warning: JNI, and hence JNIPort, will allow you to call any method of any object
or class, including private ones.
</P>

<H3><A name="Passing Primitive Types">Representing Primitive Types</A></H3>
<P>
JNIPort uses Smalltalk's own <CODE class="Smalltalk">Integers</CODE> to represent
Java's <CODE class="Java">byte</CODE>, <CODE class="Java">short</CODE>,
<CODE class="Java">int</CODE> and, <CODE class="Java">long</CODE> types.  Integer are
are range-checked before being passed to Java.  Note that the range of Java's
<CODE class="Java">byte</CODE> is -128 to +127 (however converting between a Java
<CODE class="Java">byte[]</CODE> array and a Smalltalk <CODE class="Smalltalk">ByteArray</CODE>
will also do a signed/unsigned conversion).
</P>
<P>
JNIPort uses the Smalltalk class <CODE class="Smalltalk">Float</CODE> for Java's
<CODE class="Java">float</CODE> and, <CODE class="Java">double</CODE> types.  The Smalltalk
representation has the same precision as Java's <CODE class="Java">double</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
JNIPort uses <CODE class="Smalltalk">true</CODE> and <CODE class="Smalltalk">false</CODE>
for Java's <CODE class="Java">boolean</CODE> type.
</P>
<P>
Representing Java's 16-bit <CODE class="Java">char</CODE> type is problematical.  In general,
anywhere where a character is passed to Java, JNIPort will accept either a Smalltalk
<CODE class="Smalltalk">Character</CODE> or an integer in the range 0 to 65535 (i.e. an
unsigned  16-bit representation).  When a character is passed from Java to Smalltalk, JNIPort
represents it as a <CODE class="Smalltalk">Character</CODE> if possible, or as an
<CODE class="Smalltalk">Integer</CODE> if not.  This conversion is not always possible,
so, for instance, converting a Java <CODE class="Java">java.lang.String</CODE> to a
Smalltalk <CODE class="Smalltalk">String</CODE> will throw an exception if it contains
any characters with code points over 255.  (Unfortunately, this applies to
<CODE class="Smalltalk">UnicodeString</CODE> as well.)
</P>
<P>
Java's <CODE class="Java">null</CODE> isn't a primitive type (in fact it's difficult to
say just what it should be called in Java type system &mdash; it's very much a special case),
but this is as good a place as any to mention that JNIPort always represents Java
<CODE class="Java">null</CODE> by Smalltalk <CODE class="Smalltalk">nil</CODE>.
</P>

<H3>Introspection</H3>
<P>
All <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaObjects</CODE> are able to reflect on their Java object or
class.  They know what methods, fields, and possibly constructors, it has or inherits.
See the methods in the category 'reflection'.  The class static for any class is able to
provide more reflective details about its instances than they themselves can.  See the
same category in <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
It may help to know that the objects that are answered by the reflection methods (wrappers
for instances of <CODE class="Java">java.lang.reflect.Method</CODE>,
<CODE class="Java">.Field</CODE>, and <CODE class="Java">.Constructor</CODE>) are able to
work out their own signature string.
The message is <CODE class="Smalltalk">#jniSignature</CODE>.
</P>

<H3>Java exceptions</H3>
<P>
When a Java method, or any other JNI operation, throws an exception, JNIPort catches it
and rethrows it as a Smalltalk exception.
</P>
<P>
In more detail, the Java runtime throws a Java exception, which is a Java object
inheriting from <CODE class="Java">java.lang.lang.Throwable</CODE>.  JNIPort
sees the exception object and wraps it in an instance wrapper as usual for
any Java object; this will actually be a <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangThrowable</CODE>.
It then creates a new instance of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaException</CODE>
(which is a non-resumable subclass of <CODE class="Smalltalk">Exception</CODE> via
<CODE class="Smalltalk">Error</CODE>), and raises that exception with the Java
object as its &ldquo;tag&rdquo;.
</P>
<P>
That means that uncaught Java exceptions are handled, by default, in the same
way (a walkback if it's a development session) as uncaught Smalltalk errors.
Also they can be caught and handled by a <CODE class="Smalltalk">#on:do:</CODE>
expression that lists any of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaException</CODE>,
<CODE class="Smalltalk">Error</CODE>, or <CODE class="Smalltalk">Exception</CODE>
in its filters.
</P>
<P>
A higher degree of specificity is possible; the class
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangThrowable</CODE> implements the
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#,</CODE> and <CODE class="Smalltalk">#handles:</CODE>
methods necessary to act as an exception filter too.  Therefore, if you have
specialised subclasses that correspond to Java exception classes, then you can
use the wrapper classes in an <CODE class="Smalltalk">#on:do:</CODE> expression.
</P>
<P>
A still higher degree of specificity is also possible; the class statics themselves
understand the filter protocol, so you can use them (the objects, not their classes)
as filters too.
</P>

<P>
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInstance</CODE> is one of the two immediate subclasses
of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaObject</CODE> (the other is
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE>, which is described <A href="#JavaStatic">below</A>).
Its instances all stand, in one way or another, for a real Java object.
There are three significant subclasses.  The most important is
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaClassInstance</CODE> whose instances wrap a JNI reference
to a Java object, and which act as proxies for those objects.
The other two classes, <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInterfaceInstance</CODE> and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaNonVirtual</CODE> take an existing
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaClassInstance</CODE> and wrap it in an Adaptor that presents
an alternative view of the underlying Java object as if it were a member of a different
class. All three are described below.
</P>
<P>
Every instance of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInstance</CODE> has a (shared) class static,
corresponding to the object's Java class.  The message <CODE class="Smalltalk">#static</CODE>
will answer the class static.
</P>
<P>
All instances understand all the methods of <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object</CODE>,
exposed in the normal JNIPort <A href="method-names.html">naming scheme</A>.  I.e.
they all understand:

<P>
These objects wrap raw JNI references, manage their lifetimes, and act as proxies
for the underlying Java object. They are, with class statics and the JVM object,
the most important objects in the JNIPort system.
</P>
<P>
This class establishes a framework for such proxies.  It has arbitrarily many subclasses (especially
if ghost classes are turned on!) that are used to wrap instances of specific Java classes.  Often,
such custom wrapper classes would be derived from <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangObject</CODE>,
since all Java classes inherit from <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object</CODE>, but that is
not a requirement.
<P>
JNIPort provides a way for subclasses to declare that they correspond to some specific
Java class (it is actually the <CODE class="Smalltalk">#javaClassName</CODE> method
on the class-side, see the section on <A href="wrapper-classes.html">wrapper classes</A>
for more details).  When JNIPort encounters a reference to a Java object of the corresponding
class (or a subclass) it creates a proxy of the designated Smalltalk class.
The idea is that the custom wrapper class will define helper methods that hide the need to
send messages like <CODE class="Smalltalk">#callObjectMethod:signature:withArguments:</CODE>
as described above.  You can create these wrapper classes by hand, but that quickly becomes
tedious, so the higher level of JNIPort provides two ways of automating the process.  The
<A href="wrapper-wizard.html">Wrapper Wizard</A>, writes forwarding methods for you, and
<A href="ghost-classes.html">ghost classes</A> take the idea further and makes the process
entirely dynamic and automatic.
</P>
<H4><A name="Canonical References">Canonical References</A></H4>
<P>
In normal operation, JNIPort creates a new <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaClassInstance</CODE>
whenever it encounters a new JNI reference to the underlying Java object.  That is, more than one
instance may be acting as a proxy for the same Java object.  Under most circumstances that works
perfectly well, but sometime it may be necessary to ensure that a Java object is always represented by
one specific proxy.  This may be important, for instance, if the wrapper class adds per-instance
state, or simply to allow fast comparisons using <CODE class="Smalltalk">#==</CODE>).  For this
reason, JNIPort provides the notion of a <DFN>canonical</DFN> proxy.  If an instance has been told
to <CODE class="Smalltalk">#beCanonical</CODE> then JNIPort will ensure that any subsequent
references to the Java object will be represented by that specific instance.  This is implemented
using a weak set held by each class static; see the <A href="players.html#Instance Lifecycle">object
lifecycle</A> for more information.  This feature can be turned on on a per-class basis as well,
see <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaClassStatic>>haveCanonicalInstances</CODE>, 
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaClassStatic>>haveCanonicalInstancesByDefault</CODE>, and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaClassInstance class>>haveCanonicalInstancesByDefault</CODE>.
</P>
<H4>Strings and Arrays</H4>
<P>
JNIPort comes with some standard classes for wrapping Java strings and arrays.  These are
all subclassed from <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaAggregate</CODE>.  Which, incidentally, is
an example of the way that the hierarchy of wrapper classes does not need to follow the
Java hierarchy, if there is some useful commonality that can be exploited.  In this case
the commonality is that they share code to give them a Smalltalk-style interface.
For instance, all Java arrays and strings are wrapped in objects that understand
the <CODE class="Smalltalk">#at:</CODE> message (which takes a 1-based index).
Arrays also understand <CODE class="Smalltalk">#at:put:</CODE>, strings don't because
Java's strings are immutable.  They also understand the basics of the Collections
protocols, such as <CODE class="Smalltalk">#do:</CODE> and <CODE class="Smalltalk">#size</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
There are various ways of creating arrays; you can use the class-side
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#new:jvm:</CODE> of the corresponding wrapper class, or you
can send <CODE class="Smalltalk">#newArray:</CODE> to the class static.  For instance
this code creates an array of 9 <CODE class="Java">doubles</CODE> and 10
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Strings</CODE>:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	jvm := JVM current.
	doubleArray := JavaDoubleArray new: 9 jvm: jvm.
	stringClass := jvm findClass: #'java.lang.String'.
	stringArray := stringClass newArray: 10.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
There are also several ways of creating Java strings.  The easiest is to send
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#asJavaString:</CODE> to a Smalltalk string:
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	jvm := JVM current.
	javaString := 'Test!' asJavaString: jvm.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
You can convert Java arrays into Smalltalk arrays with <CODE class="Smalltalk">#asArray</CODE>,
and Java strings into Smalltalk strings with <CODE class="Smalltalk">#asString</CODE>.
Note, however, that not all Java strings can be represented in Dolphin Smalltalk since
Dolphin does not yet support 16-bit characters.
</P>
<P>
Java <CODE class="Java">byte[]</CODE> arrays and Smalltalk
<CODE class="Smalltalk">ByteArrays</CODE> can be converted into each other with
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#asByteArray</CODE> and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#asJavaByteArray:</CODE>
respectively.  The conversion also maps between Smalltalk's unsigned bytes and
Java's signed ones.

The second subclass of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInstance</CODE> can be used to represent
Java objects that are known to implement some interface.
</P>
<P>
Java makes heavy use of interfaces; they are one of Java's best features, but they do
cause a problem for wrapper classes.  For instance, the Java interface 
<CODE class="Java">java.util.Iterator</CODE> defines two useful methods for looping
over Java collections, but there are many Java classes which implement
the interface and they are not related by inheritance.  The problem is that, while it is
easy to generate a wrapper for any one of those classes, you wouldn't want to have to
duplicate the wrapper code for all the rest of them.
</P>
<P>
There are several workable solutions to the problem; JNIPort has one built in &mdash;
<DFN>interface instances</DFN>.  Roughly, the idea is that, just as for instance wrappers, you
tell JNIPort that a certain wrapper class should be used for Java objects that implement a
certain interface.  It will then arrange to wrap those objects in instances of your class.
However, the picture is different in one important aspect: JNIPort <EM>always</EM> wraps
a reference to a Java object in the proxy class that is most appropriate given the
Java object's class; it can't do that with interfaces.  A Java object has exactly one class,
but may implement several interfaces, so JNIPort can't follow the usual pattern in this case.
The way that this is handled is that interface instances are more like Adaptors; they take
an existing wrapper object (with its own class static and so on), and put it inside
<EM>another</EM> object, with a different class static, that &ldquo;knows&rdquo; about
the interface and how to invoke its methods.
</P>
<P>
These secondary wrapper objects are created by sending
<CODE class="Smalltalk">asInstanceOf:</CODE> to an existing wrapper, where the parameter
is the class static of the interface you are interested in.  Alternatively the
<CODE class="Smalltalk">asA:</CODE> method takes the Symbol name of the interface.
</P>
<P>
For instance, if you have a reference to a Java object that you know implements
<CODE class="Java">java.util.Iterator</CODE>, but which doesn't have a special wrapper
class of its own.  Because it doesn't have a custom wrapper class, the instance
will be wrapped in the fallback <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangObject</CODE>,
and not know anything about the methods of <CODE class="Java">Iterator</CODE>.
You can send <CODE class="Smalltalk">asA: #'java.util.Iterator'</CODE> to it
to get back an adaptor that not only understands <CODE class="Smalltalk">#hasNext</CODE>
and <CODE class="Smalltalk">#next</CODE>, but is able to understand
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#do:</CODE>.  (This example requires the 'CU Java Additional
Wrappers' package.)

The last useful subclass of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInstance</CODE> is of minor importance,
indeed it is more than slightly esoteric.  It wouldn't exist at all except that it falls, almost
for nothing, out of the implementation, and provides a way of exposing one of JNI's features
that otherwise would have been hidden.
</P>
<P>
A <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaNonVirtual</CODE> is an object that pairs a class static with
an instance wrapper.  It acts as if the underlying object were an instance of the Java class
corresponding to the class static, but it bypasses Java's virtual method invocation.
</P>
<P>
For example, sending <CODE class="Smalltalk">#super</CODE> to any instance proxy will
answer a <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaNonVirtual</CODE> that pretends that the underlying
Java object is really an instance of its superclass.  Given a Java Point object, calling its
<CODE class="Java">toString()</CODE> method will answer a Java string describing the point:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	class := JVM current findClass: #'java.awt.Point'.
	point := class new.
	point toString.
		"--> a JavaLangString(java.awt.Point[x=0,y=0])"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
but sending <CODE class="Smalltalk">#super</CODE> to it will answer a different view of
the same object that does not override the implementation of
<CODE class="Java">toString()</CODE> that it inherits from
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object</CODE>:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	point super toString.
		"--> a JavaLangString(java.awt.Point@0)"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Please note the non-virtual object will not be a member of any of the wrapper classes
so, except for the methods of <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Object</CODE>,  it can only
be accessed using the low-level methods of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaObject</CODE>.

<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE> is second of the two immediate subclasses
of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaObject</CODE>; its instances stand for Java classes and
interfaces. They are known as <DFN>class statics</DFN>.
</P>
<P>
Class statics provide access to the &ldquo;static members&rdquo; of a Java class
in the same way that instance wrappers provide access to the non-static members.
They also provide a way to call the constructors of a Java class.
</P>
<P>
There are subclasses of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE> that correspond
to Java classes, interfaces, and primitive types.  Although this breakdown resembles
that below <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInstance</CODE>, the parallel is misleading.
The subclasses of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInstance</CODE> are fundamentally different
things with different roles, whereas the subclasses of
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE> are all very similar.  In fact the breakdown
is more to allow JNIPort to substitute polymorphism for runtime tests, than it is to
reflect real semantic differences.  One exception is that only the subclass
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaClassStatic</CODE> defines the methods
for calling Java constructors (since you cannot instantiate interfaces or primitive
types).
</P>
<P>
Instances are always paired with a <CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE> object
for that class or type.  The class object has a JNIPort wrapper in the normal way,
actually an instance of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaLangClass</CODE>.  The class <EM>object</EM>
exposes the fixed set of 30 (or more) methods that all instances of
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Class</CODE> understand.  The class <EM>static</EM> understands
the programmer-defined fields and methods of the Java class.  Class objects know what class
static they are paired with (and answer it to <CODE class="Smalltalk">#classStatic</CODE>);
class statics know what class object they are paired with (and answer it to
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#classObject</CODE>).
</P>
<P>
Each instance wrapper knows that it &ldquo;belongs to&rdquo; the class static that
stands for its Java class.  The message <CODE class="Smalltalk">#static</CODE> will
answer the owner.
</P>
<P>
The other common way to find a class static is to look it up by name; the JVM object
understands <CODE class="Smalltalk">#findClass:</CODE>, which takes the Symbol
name of a Java class, interface, or type, and answers the corresponding class static.
For instance:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	jvm := JVM current.
	jvm findClass: #'java.awt.Point'.
	jvm findClass: #'int'.
	jvm findClass: #'java.lang.String[]'.
	jvm findClass: #'double[][]'.
</CODE></PRE>
<!-- UPDATEME -->
<P>
(Class statics can also be obtained by asking other
<code class="Smalltalk">&lt;javaClassFinder&gt;</code>s, such as the new &ldquo;supplementary
classloaders&rdquo;, but that feature is still experimental, and is not discussed further here.)
</P>
<P>
Class statics know how to wrap JNI references in proxies of the correct class (this
is their most important role in the <EM>implementation</EM> of JNIPort).  They work
with the class registry to maintain the mapping from Java classes to Smalltalk
wrapper classes, See the <A href="players.html">Players</A> section for more detail
on this.
</P>
<P>
Class statics know about their place in the Java class hierarchy.  There are a number
of methods in the category 'Java class hierarchy' that provide access to this;
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#javaSuperclass</CODE> is the most basic.  Note that you can
only ask for the <EM>known</EM> subclasses, neither JNIPort nor the Java runtime itself
can possibly determine how many more subclasses may later be loaded (or even created).
</P>
<P>
Class statics also know how to create Java arrays of the right type to hold values
of their Java class.  For instance the class static for Java's <CODE class="Java">int</CODE>
primitive type knows how to create <CODE class="Java">int[]</CODE> arrays:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	jvm := JVM current.
	intClass := jvm findClass: #'int'.
	array := intClass newArray: 10.
	     "or"
	array := intClass newArrayWithAll: #( 1 2 3 4).
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
See the methods in category 'arrays' for more ways to create arrays.
</P>
<P>
The subclass <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaClassStatic</CODE> has methods for invoking
the Java class's constructors.  The are in category 'instance creation'.  Calling
a constructor is like calling a Java method, except that there is no method name.  You
have to supply a signature string and a <CODE class="Smalltalk">JNIValueArray</CODE> to
hold any parameters.
</P>
<P>
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaStatic</CODE> is intended to be a superclass for custom
subclasses that wrap the class-side of a Java class, in very much the same way that
custom subclasses of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaInstance</CODE> wrap the instance-side.
JNIPort uses the same kind of mechanism for associating a custom subclass with
some specific Java class (and its subclasses).  Similarly the Wrapper Wizard
and ghost classes provide ways of automating the process.  See the <A href="wrapper-classes.html">
Wrapper Classes</A> section for more detail.  JNIPort has many examples of this.
