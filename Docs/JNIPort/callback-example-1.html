<H1>An Example of Using Callbacks</H1>
<P>
This section is an example of using <A href="callbacks.html">callbacks</A> from
Java into Smalltalk.  The first half uses callbacks to create a Swing window
showing the Smalltalk class hierarchy.  The second half adds an event listener
to the tree that allows Smalltalk code to observe the tree's &ldquo;selection
change&rdquo; events 
</P>
<HR>
<P>
JNIPort should be configured to use ghost classes and support callbacks.
To configure ghost classes, ensure that the list of 'watcherClasses', under
'jniPortSettings', includes <CODE class="Smalltalk">JVMGhostClassMaker</CODE>,
there is no need to change the 'ghostClassSettings' from their defaults.
To enable callbacks the 'jvmClass' setting, under 'jniPortSettings', should
be set to <CODE class="Smalltalk">JVMWithCallbacks</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
Since AWT/Swing uses Java threads, you should
make sure that the <A href="jni-helper.html">JNI Helper</A> is installed, or
that you are not hooking the Java runtime's debugging output. If you followed
the instructions in the <A href="walkthrough.html">installation walkthrough</A>
then JNI Helper will be configured.
</P>
<P>
Once a suitably configured JVM is running, you can test whether callbacks are
properly configured by displaying the Status Monitor's 
<A href="status-monitor-console.html">console page</A>.  If it does not show
a warning message, then callbacks are probably configured.  You can test that
they are working by sending some text to the Java console:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	jvm := JVM current.
	jvm stdout nextPutAll: 'Testing...'; cr.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
We are getting ahead of ourselves; before we can experiment with callbacks we'll
have to write some Java code that uses them.
</P>
<HR>
<H2>Using Callback Requests</H2>
<H3>Java Code</H3>
<P>
In this example, we create a Java
<CODE class="Java">javax.swing.tree.TreeModel</CODE> that appears (to Java) to
hold a tree of Smalltalk classes.  In fact it will be a tree of the string
names of Smalltalk classes (JNIPort does not provide any way for Java code to
refer directly to Smalltalk objects &mdash; garbage collection would become a
nightmare&hellip;).
</P>
<P>
Java <CODE class="Java">TreeModel</CODE> is an interface, so we define a class
that implements it.  The important methods are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE class="Java">getChild()</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="Java">getChildCount()</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="Java">getIndexOfChild()</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>
These will be used by Swing to populate the tree; we will implement them
by sending callback requests to Dolphin.
</P>
<P>
The source for the Java class is <A href="TreeModelExample.java"><CODE class="java">
org.metagnostic.jniport.eg.TreeModelExample.java</CODE></A>.  The rest of this
section will mention some of the highlights.
</P>
<P>
Callbacks always have a &ldquo;tag&rdquo; object to identify the request.  This
should be unique and should last for as long as callbacks are in use.  A handy
way to set this up is to use Java strings for the tags, held as static variables
in the class:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Java">    private static final Object
        s_getChildTag = new String("TreeModelExample.getChildTag()"),
        s_getChildCountTag = new String("TreeModelExample.getChildCount()"),
        s_getIndexOfChildTag = new String("TreeModelExample.getIndexOfChild()");
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
That creates three tag objects that will be used to identify the three callback
requests.  It creates new strings for the tags, rather than just using string
literals, in order to <EM>guarantee</EM> that the tags are unique.
</P>
<P>
We also define some static &ldquo;getter&rdquo; methods for the tags, since
our Smalltalk code will need to know what they are before it can link them
to the proper callback handlers.  We could just as well have made the tags
themselves public (since they are static and final, they are really just constants),
or even configured JNIPort to read the private variables directly.
Yet another option would be to make the &ldquo;getters&rdquo; be <EM>instance</EM>
methods (but still returning the value of the static tags), it all depends on
how you are using the callbacks.
</P>
<P>
Now to define the methods that call back into Smalltalk.  Starting with:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Java">    public int
    getChildCount(Object parent)
    {
        try
        {
            DolphinRequest req = new DolphinRequest(
                                    s_getChildCountTag,
                                    this,
                                    parent);
            Object value = req.value();
            return ((Integer)value).intValue();
        }
        catch (Throwable e)
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
This is called by Swing to see how many children a given node has.
The meat of the methods is inside the try/catch block. First it creates a
<CODE class="Java">DolphinRequest</CODE> object, passing the tag that
is used to identify 'getChildCount' requests.  It also passes itself,
&ldquo;this&rdquo;, as the originator of the request (which will not be
used in this example), and the parent object as the
parameter to the request.  In fact the parent will be a Java string
naming a Smalltalk class, but the interfaces are defined to take
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Objects</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
It then calls the request's <CODE class="Java">value()</CODE> method.
That will block the calling thread (actually the Swing user-interface
thread) while the callback is handled by code in Dolphin (which we'll
write later).  Callbacks can only return Java objects, so the callback
returns the number of subclasses of our parent class as a 
<CODE class="Java">java.lang.Integer</CODE>.  We unpack the primitive
<CODE class="Java">int</CODE> equivalent and return it to our caller.
</P>
<P>
The try/catch block is needed because
<CODE class="Java">DolphinRequest.value()</CODE> is declared to
throw any possible Java exception.  The Smalltalk code can generate
any exception it likes, so we have to handle the possibility explicitly.
For production code, handling all exceptions the same way would be a
bad idea &mdash; we should at least log them &mdash; but it's OK for
a simple example like this.
</P>
<P>
The next of our callback methods is:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Java">    public Object
    getChild(Object parent, int index)
    {
        try
        {
            DolphinRequest req = new DolphinRequest(
                                    s_getChildTag,
                                    this,
                                    parent,
                                    new Integer(index));
            return req.value();
        }
        catch (Throwable e)
        {
            return null;
        }
    }
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
This is called by Swing to get the Nth child of a given parent.  It is
allowed to return <CODE class="Java">null</CODE> if the parent is not
valid or it doesn't have that many children.  Remember that the index
of the child is 0-based, as always in Java.
</P>
<P>
This also creates a <CODE class="Java">DolphinRequest</CODE> object, this
time with the tag for 'getChild' requests, it uses a different constructor
that takes two arguments and packs them into the single parameter as an
<CODE class="Java">Object[]</CODE> array with two elements.  The return
value from the callback will be a Java string naming the Nth subclass of
the parent (or null), so we can just return that directly from this method.
</P>
<P>
The last of our callback methods is:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Java">    public int
    getIndexOfChild(Object parent, Object child)
    {
        if (parent == null || child == null)
            return -1;
        try
        {
            DolphinRequest req = new DolphinRequest(
                                    s_getIndexOfChildTag,
                                    this,
                                    parent,
                                    child);
            Object value = req.value();
            return ((Integer)value).intValue();
        }
        catch (Throwable e)
        {
            return -1;
        }
    }
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
This is called by Swing to find the index of a child within the list of its
siblings.  The implementation does not differ interestingly from the other
two callback methods.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Java class is just a boilerplate implementation of a
<CODE class="Java">TreeModel</CODE>, and is not worth discussing.
</P>
<P>
You should compile the class and ensure it is somewhere on the JNIPort
classpath.  The .JAR file, 'JNIPort-Tests.jar', which is supplied with
JNIPort in the 'Extras\' folder already includes a compiled version
of the code, so if that JAR file is on the classpath then you should
be OK already.
</P>
<H3>Smalltalk Code</H3>
<P>
It would be possible to use our new Java class entirely by typing into
a Smalltalk workspace, but it wouldn't make for a very clear example.
Instead we'll generate a proper wrapper class.
</P>
<P>
In this case, the Java tree will be showing the state of the entire
Smalltalk image, rather than the state of some specific Smalltalk
object.  That's a slightly unnatural case, but it does keep the
example simple.  We can define all the code we need to handle
callbacks as methods attached to the class static for
<CODE class="java">TreeModelExample</CODE>.
Someday I may add a more realistic example&hellip;
</P>
<P>
We start by using the <A href="wrapper-wizard.html">Wrapper Wizard</A>
to generate a class-side wrapper class for our example.  First ensure
that JNIPort has loaded our class, we can do that by choosing
the 'Find/Load Java class' command from the class menu of the Status
Monitor's <A href="status-monitor-classes.html">classes page</A>. Enter the
full name of the class, 'org.metagnostic.jniport.eg.TreeModelExample' in the
dialog box (this is case-sensitive).  If you have compiled
the class, and it is somewhere where JNIPort and the Java runtime can find it,
then the classes page will load the class (if it wasn't before) and select
it in the class tree.
</P>
<P>
Now to generate a static wrapper class.  If you select
'Generate class-side wrappers...' from the 'Class' menu, then the Wrapper
Wizard will start.  If you have the 'CU Java Examples' package installed
then the Wizard will have selected the pre-defined wrapper class for 
<CODE class="java">TreeModelExample</CODE>, and you may as well just
kill the Wizard now because the wrapper is already defined.  If not, then
the Wizard should have selected class
<CODE class="Smalltalk">StaticJavaLangObject</CODE> as the best available
approximation to an approprate static wrapper class.  The 'Next' button
will be disabled, though, because the Wizard knows that
<CODE class="Smalltalk">StaticJavaLangObject</CODE> is already used to
wrap <CODE class="java">java.lang.Object</CODE>.  You'll need to make a
new subclass for wrapping our Java example.  You can create it from the
context menu in the class selection pane, call it what you like, but
the pre-defined version is called
<CODE class="Smalltalk">StaticOMJEgTreeNodeExample</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
Once you have created the target class the Wizard should let you go on
to populate it, just accept all the defaults.  It will create the new
methods and add them to the target class.
</P>
<P>
Now we hit an awkwardness.  We are using ghost classes, but ghost classes
don't really support having new wrapper classes added to the system while
it is already running (it wouldn't be a problem if we weren't using ghosts, we
could just let the Wizard &ldquo;register&rdquo; the new class and all
would be well).  It is possible to tell JNIPort to use the new class, but
I haven't yet created a public API for doing so, let alone a GUI.  So, I'm afraid,
the easiest thing to do is just close down JNIPort and restart.
Of course, that means that &mdash; thanks to Sun &mdash; you'll also
have to close and restart Dolphin before you can start the new JVM.  Sorry!
</P>
<P>
After all this messing around, we have managed to create a static wrapper
class for <CODE class="java">TreeModelExample</CODE>, so that class should
be represented by a Smalltalk object that is an instance of (a ghost subclass of)
<CODE class="Smalltalk">StaticOMJEgTreeNodeExample</CODE>.  You can verify
that by looking at the class's 'Inheritance' tab in the class page of the
Status Monitor.
</P>
<P>
Now we want to tell our new wrapper object how to handle the callbacks
from Java.  We'll add the following method to 
<CODE class="Smalltalk">StaticOMJEgTreeNodeExample</CODE>:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">notifyRegistered
    | callbackRegistry |

    callbackRegistry := self jvm callbackRegistry ifNil: [^ self].

    callbackRegistry
        setCallback: self getChildTag_null
	handler: [:it :params | self handleGetChild: params].
    callbackRegistry
        setCallback: self getChildCountTag_null
	handler: [:it :params | self handleGetChildCount: params].
    callbackRegistry
        setCallback: self getIndexOfChildTag_null
	handler: [:it :params | self handleGetIndexOfChild: params].
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
That method is normally called by JNIPort as the wrapper class is first
registered.  It won't have been called yet, though, so you can either
restart JNIPort again <I>&lt;evil grin&gt;</I>, or you can find the
class static and send it the message manually with code like:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	class := jvm findClass: #'org.metagnostic.jniport.eg.TreeModelExample'.
	class notifyRegistered.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
whichever you do, you should find that the Status Monitor's
<A href="status-monitor-status.html">status page</A> now shows that the number
of registered callbacks has gone up by three.
</P>
<P>
What the <CODE class="Smalltalk">notifyRegistered</CODE> method does, is to
find the three tags for the callbacks using the static getters that we defined
(the calls to <CODE class="Smalltalk">self getChildTag_null</CODE> etc),
and then to register a handler block for each with the callback registry.
The handler blocks take two arguments which correspond to the originator
and parameter of the callback requests.
</P>
<P>
Note the check that the callback registry isn't <CODE class="Smalltalk">nil</CODE>,
that is equivalent to checking that the JVM object supports callbacks.  Without
the test, JNIPort would encounter errors as it tried to register this wrapper
if callbacks were not enabled.
</P>
<P>
Each handler block just forwards the parameter to a corresponding handler
method; we now have to write those.  Start with the handler for 'getChildCount':
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">handleGetChildCount: aJavaLangString
	"called from Java as the implementation of int getChildCount(Object)"

	| name classes |

	name := aJavaLangString asString.

	"get list of subclasses"
	classes := name = '&lt&lt;root&gt;&gt;'
			ifTrue: [Class allRoots]
			ifFalse: [(Smalltalk at: name) subclasses].

	"we want to return the number of subclasses as a java.lang.Integer"
	^ (jvm findClass: #'java.lang.Integer') new_int: classes size.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Recall that in this case the parameter to the callback was just the string
name of a class.  The implementation is straightforward: convert the Java
string to a Smalltalk string, find the named Smalltalk class, find out
how many direct subclasses it has, and return a
<CODE class="java">java.lang.Integer</CODE> that encodes that number.
The only complication is that we use the special string '&lt&lt;root&gt;&gt;'
to ask for the list of root classes.
</P>
<P>
This method doesn't bother with any error checking, which would not be a good
idea for production code, but it keeps the example simple.  If any errors
did occur, then they would be trapped by JNIPort and rethrown as Java
errors in the caller.  (Which means, by the way, that you won't get
walkbacks from errors in hander code.  You <EM>can</EM> put breakpoints in
handlers if you wish.)
</P>
<P>
The next of our handler methods is the implementation of the 'getChild'
request:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">handleGetChild: aJavaArray
	"called from Java as the implementation of Object getChild(Object, int)"

	| name index classes class |

	name := aJavaArray at: 1.	"should be a java.Lang.String naming a class or '&lt&lt;root&gt;&gt;'"
	name := name asString.

	index := aJavaArray at: 2.	"should be a java.lang.Integer (0-based)"
	index := index intValue_null + 1.

	"get list of subclasses"
	classes := name = '&lt&lt;root&gt;&gt;'
			ifTrue: [Class allRoots]
			ifFalse: [(Smalltalk at: name) subclasses].

	"we want to return the name of the indexed subclass as a Java string"
	class := classes at: index ifAbsent: [^ nil].
	^ class name asJavaString: self jvm.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
In this case, remember, the caller passed two arguments packed into a Java
array, so the first thing we do is unpack them.  The first element is the
name of the parent class, the second is an <CODE class="java">java.lang.Integer</CODE>
that encodes the 0-based index of the child.
</P>
<P>
Having unpacked the parameters, we get the list of subclasses of the named class
(again treating '&lt&lt;root&gt;&gt;' specially), find the indexed element of that
list, and return its name converted to a Java string.
</P>
<P>
The last of our handler methods is the implementation of the 'getIndexOfChild'
request:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">handleGetIndexOfChild: aJavaArray
	"called from Java as the implementation of Integer getIndexOfChild(Object, Object)"

	| parentName childName classes child index |

	parentName := aJavaArray at: 1.	"should be a java.Lang.String naming a class or '&lt&lt;root&gt;&gt;'"
	parentName := parentName asString.

	childName := aJavaArray at: 2.	"should be a java.Lang.String naming a class"
	childName := childName asString.

	"get list of subclasses"
	classes := parentName = '&lt&lt;root&gt;&gt;'
			ifTrue: [Class allRoots]
			ifFalse: [(Smalltalk at: parentName) subclasses].

	"find child"
	child := Smalltalk at: childName.
	index := classes indexOf: child.

	"we want to return the index (0-based) as a java.lang.Integer"
	^ (jvm findClass: #'java.lang.Integer') new_int: index-1.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Which is similar to the previous two handlers.
</P>
<P>
All this Smalltalk code is provided as part of the 'CU Java Examples' package.
</P>
<H3>Running It</H3>
<P>
Now we are in a position to try out our new code.  We'll create the Swing
window from a workspace.  We start,
as always, by getting a reference to the JVM object:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	jvm := JVM current.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
First we make an instance of our tree model class:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	tm := (jvm findClass: #'org.metagnostic.jniport.eg.TreeModelExample') new.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
You could test it out from the workspace if you wanted.  For instance:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	root := tm getRoot_null.
	tm getChildCount_Object: root.
		"--> 2"
	tm getChild_Object: root int: 0.
		"--> a java.lang.String(Object)"
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Now we make a Swing window to display the tree model.  If this is the first
time you have loaded any Swing class in this JNIPort session then there will
be the usual irritating delay as JNIPort loads lots of Swing classes.  We
create a frame, add a scrolling pane within it, and a JTree within that.
We tell the JTree to use our tree model as the source of its data.
See the Java documentation for how it all fits together.
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	frame := (jvm findClass: #'javax.swing.JFrame') new_String: 'Smalltalk Classes'.
	frame setDefaultCloseOperation_int: (frame static get_DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE).
	tree := (jvm findClass: #'javax.swing.JTree') new_TreeModel: tm.
	pane := (jvm findClass: #'javax.swing.JScrollPane') new_Component: tree.
	frame getContentPane_null add_Component: pane.
	tree setRootVisible_boolean: false.
	tree setShowsRootHandles_boolean: true.
	frame pack_null; setVisible_boolean: true.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
And then&hellip;
</P>
<P>
<I>Ta da&hellip;</I>
</P>
<P>
<IMG
	src="callback-example-1.gif"
	alt="Swing Tree Component showing Smalltalk Class Hierarchy">
</P>
<P>
You will probably notice that it is pretty slow, especially if you open up
the 'Object' branch, and then scroll around.  One reason is that Swing is
sending lots of callbacks as it scrolls (on the order of 100 per second
on my machine), and callbacks are slow.  The other is that JNIPort is
creating lots of wrappers for references to Java objects; if you look
at the <A href="status-monitor-history.html">history page</A> of the
status monitor, then you should see that scrolling the tree is causing
JNIPort to create and discard perhaps a thousand wrapper objects per second.
</P>
<P>
There is an important lesson to be learned from this.  As the section
on callbacks warns, callbacks are slow and are not suited to creating
tight integration between Java and Smalltalk code.
</P>
<P>
In this case, a better implementation would probably have used a cache
in the Java tree object and only called back into Smalltalk when it needed
to fill, or refresh, the cache.  Another possibility would be to avoid
callbacks altogether, and to create and populate the tree object entirely by
calling down from Smalltalk into Java.
</P>
<HR>
<H2>Using Events</H2>
<P>
Now that we have our tree showing Smalltalk classes, we can use it to
experiment with Java events.  JNIPort includes a way to arrange that
Java events can be forwarded into Smalltalk, see
<A href="callbacks.html#Events">events</A> in the Callbacks section for the
background.  We'll use it now to observe selection change events in the tree.
</P>
<P>
Firstly we are going to have the selection change events triggered off
the Smalltalk proxy for the Java tree pane.  However that means that we
must ensure that we are using a
<A href="java-base.html#Canonical References">canonical</A> reference
to the pane.  That is easily arranged by sending
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#beCanonical</CODE> to its proxy, which will ensure
that JNIPort uses the same proxy for all references to that Java object.
(It doesn't do that by default to avoid doing a lookup for every new reference
to a Java object):
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	tree beCanonical.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Now we find the Java event we are interested in.  In Java events are
represented as methods in listener interfaces, so start by finding
the selection changed method; the one we want is
<CODE class="Java">valueChanged()</CODE> in interface
<CODE class="Java">javax.swing.event.TreeSelectionListener</CODE>:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	interface := jvm findClass: #'javax.swing.event.TreeSelectionListener'.
	eventMethod := interface abstractMethods
			detect: [:each | each name = 'valueChanged'].
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Next we create an event forwarder.  That is a Java object that implements the
<CODE class="Java">TreeSelectionListener</CODE> interface by forwarding the
selection changed event into Smalltalk:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	forwarder := eventMethod eventForwarder: #selectionChanged:.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
Creating the forwarder also sets up a handler for the callback that will trigger
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#selectionChanged:</CODE> (in this case) off
the Smalltalk proxy for the source of the event.
</P>
<P>
Now all we have to do is to add our new listener object to the tree pane's list
of observers:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Smalltalk">	tree addTreeSelectionListener_TreeSelectionListener: forwarder.
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
And now, any selection changes will be reported in Smalltalk space as 
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#selectionChanged:</CODE> events triggered off the
<CODE class="Smalltalk">tree</CODE> object.  The parameter to the event will be
the <CODE class="Java">javax.swing.event.TreeSelectionEvent</CODE> object
that the Java tree pane generates and passes as an argument to 
<CODE class="Java">valueChanged()</CODE>, it contains details of what has
changed.
</P>
<P>
Use your favourite event tracing tool to verify that it is working.
