<H1>The Java Native Interface (JNI)</H1>
<P>
JNI, the &ldquo;Java Native Interface&rdquo;, is the API by which programs written in C,
or a similar language, can interact with a Java runtime.  Dolphin's external interfacing
feature is able to use the JNI API and the whole of JNIPort is built on it.
</P>
<P>
The JNI specification is included in the J2SDK documentation; by all means read it (if you
don't know it already) but be warned: JNI is one of the most unpleasant APIs I've ever
worked with.  To be fair, a lot of that is because Sun were in the difficult position of
specifying a low-level interface to a garbage collected virtual machine <EM>without</EM>
constraining the implementation of the VM or garbage collector.  On the other hand, I don't
doubt that much of the difficulty is because the JNI API was rushed and poorly thought-out.
</P>
<P>
I have no intention of writing an introduction to JNI; if you are interested then you
may like to look at the
<A href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/native1.1/index.html" target=_blank>
JNI trail</A> in the
<A href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/index.html" target=_blank>Java tutorial</A>.
Sun have also put the JNI book <A href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jni" target=_blank>online</A>.
</P>
<P>
The rest of this section assumes that you know both JNI and Dolphin's external interfacing (which
may be an unrealistic expectation, I admit).
</P>
<P>
The package 'CU JNI' contains <CODE class="Smalltalk">ExternalStructure</CODE> subclasses
corresponding to the JNI structures:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE class="C">JavaVMInitArgs</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="C">JavaVMOption</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="C">JNINativeMethod</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="C">jvalue</CODE> (and arrays thereof)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
plus the two vtable-like structures:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE class="C">JavaVM</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE class="C">JNIEnv</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>
which, luckily, are close enough to the layout of a real COM or C++ object for
Dolphin to be able to handle them without trouble.
</P>
<P>
By the way, don't confuse the <CODE class="C">JavaVM</CODE> structure with the JNIPort JVM
object; the JVM object is of a different class (<CODE class="Smalltalk">JVM</CODE>!) and
<EM>contains</EM> a <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaVM</CODE> object.  The name &ldquo;JavaVM&rdquo;
is just a poor choice by Sun.
</P>
<P>
The package also contains an <CODE class="Smalltalk">ExternalLibrary</CODE> subclass that
exposes the functions exported by the Java runtime DLL.  In fact there are several such
libraries, one for each kind of Java runtime I've tried.  These differ only in the way that
they locate the Java DLL at runtime.
</P>
<P>
The package also includes <CODE class="Smalltalk">ExternalAddress</CODE> subclasses corresponding
to the various kinds of opaque pointer used by JNI.  Most importantly the &ldquo;local&rdquo;
and &ldquo;global&rdquo; references to Java objects.
</P>
<P>
The idea of this package is to provide only a very thin layer around raw JNI.  It is important
(should you use this layer without the rest of JNIPort) that you realise that it does
not manage the lifetime of references to Java objects automatically, you have to track references
yourself and release them explicitly.
</P>
<P>
The package does go a little beyond the raw JNI specification.  It provides a set of subclasses
of <CODE class="Smalltalk">JNIReference</CODE> corresponding to both the local and global flavours
of the &ldquo;typed&rdquo; references (<CODE class="C++">jclass</CODE>,
<CODE class="C++">jarray</CODE>, <CODE class="C++">jstring</CODE>, and so on). It also provides
type-preserving conversions between local and global references.
</P>
<P>
The central objects at this level are the JNIEnv &ldquo;pointers&rdquo;.  A JNIEnv is like a COM
object or a pointer to a C++ object; it has no (public) data, just a load of methods (about
300) that are the meat of the JNI API.  This package exposes the methods as Smalltalk methods.
The way that JNI works requires the programmer to check for errors/exceptions after each
step, so the <CODE class="Smalltalk">JNIEnv</CODE> class also has checked versions of all the
methods.
</P>
<P>
For two simple (Ha!) examples of raw JNI programming using this package, see
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JNIReference>>toString:</CODE> and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JNIReference>>equals:jniEnv:</CODE>.  Of course, the rest of JNIPort
contains many more examples.
