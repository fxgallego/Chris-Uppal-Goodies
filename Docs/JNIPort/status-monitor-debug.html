<H1>The Status Monitor's JVM Debug Page</H1>
<P>
The <DFN>Status Page</DFN> is a plug-in page for the <A href="status-monitor.html">Status
Monitor</A>.  It displays a trace of the debugging output from the Java runtime.
</P>
<P>
<IMG src="status-monitor-debug.gif" alt="Status Monitor showing JVM Debug page">
</P>
<P>
In a Java program launched by the
<CODE>java.exe</CODE> program, this stream goes to the console along with the Java console streams
(but it is a separate stream and is handled differently).  The <CODE>java.exe</CODE> program
has several options that turn on debugging output from different subsystems of the Java
runtime.  Standard options such as <CODE>-verbose:gc</CODE>, or  <CODE>-verbose:class</CODE>,
and less standard options like <CODE>-Xcheck:jni</CODE> for SUN JMVs, enable the corresponding
logging.
The same debugging options can also be used with JNIPort; they are just added to the list in
the 'runtimeSettings' (see <A href="setup.html">Configuration</A>).
</P>
<P>
When Java is running from Dolphin there is no console, so the logging would be lost.
However JNI provides a way of reading the debug stream.  If JNIPort has been configured to
do so, then this debugging output is captured, and &mdash; if the JVM Debug page is open
&mdash; displayed. JNIPort will capture the output if 'useVFPrintfHook' is set in the
'jniPortSettings'.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Please note the following warning:</STRONG> much of the runtime's debugging
output is produced by operating-system threads other than the one where Dolphin
executes Smalltalk code.  If no precautions are taken then this is very likely
to lead to deadlocks.  See <A href="threading.html">the problem with threads</A>
for more discussion of this point.
</P>
<P>
The first precaution is that you should be using the <A href="jni-helper.html">JNI Helper</A>
library.  This interposes a queue between the thread issuing the debugging data, and Dolphin, so
that the sending thread does not need to wait for Dolphin to consume the data.  This should
avoid the problem, and I have found that, with the JNI Helper, I can use the JVM Debug page without
encountering deadlocks.  But, of course, that may just be luck (for instance I rarely run JNIPort
with <CODE>-verbose:gc</CODE>).
</P>
<P>
If you need to see the debug output, but are still getting deadlocks despite using JNI Helper
(or just can't risk ever hitting a deadlock), then you can use an additional feature of JNIPort/JNI
Helper.  The configuration setting 'jniPortSettings/useVFPrintfRedirection' tells JNIPort
to divert the debugging information directly to the Windows debug stream without ever
involving Dolphin.  (Note that 'jniPortSettings/useVFPrintfHook' still has to be set, or JNIPort
won't install a handler at all.)  The useful (and free) tool, DebugView, from
<A href="http://www.sysinternals.com/" target=_blank>http://www.sysinternals.com/</A> can be used
to trace the output.
</P>
<P>
Another reason to use the 'useVFPrintfRedirection' flag is if you have some Java problem that
is crashing Dolphin &mdash; in which case you wouldn't get the chance to read any error
messages in the debug page.
</P>
<P>
If the debugging output is not being captured by JNIPort, or it is being redirected to the
Windows debug stream, then the JVM Debug page will not work, and will just display a warning
message.
