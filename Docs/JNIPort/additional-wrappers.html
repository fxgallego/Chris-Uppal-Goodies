<H1>Additional Pre-defined Wrapper Classes</H1>
<P>
JNIPort comes with a package of extra pre-defined <A href="wrapper-classes.html">wrapper classes</A>.
These are provided:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>As examples.</LI>
<LI>In case they come in useful.</LI>
<LI>Because I'd generated them anyway, so I might as well throw them in&hellip;</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The additional wrappers are not needed by JNIPort proper, although they are used by
some of the <A href="examples.html">examples</A>.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of them wrap common Java classes, the Java 2 Collections, the Java IO classes, and
the Java iterators, and give them something of the protocol of the Smalltalk equivalents.
</P>
<P>
There are a few other wrapper classes in the package, but none of them add much, if anything, to
what the <A href="wrapper-wizard.html">Wrapper Wizard</A> generated.
</P>
<P>
Just as a warning: these wrapper classes are not, in general, as lavishly commented as is
my habit.  You are expected to know the Smalltalk interface to the various Collection classes,
for example, and if you are looking at the implementation of the adaptors then you are also
expected to know about the equivalent Java classes.  For similar reasons, this section is very short.
</P>
<H2>IO-Stream Wrappers</H3>
<P>
There are two classes, <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaReadStream</CODE> and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaWriteStream</CODE>, which act as root classes for instance-side
wrappers for the root classes of the Java IO hierarchy.  They attempt to emulate the protocols
of the corresponding Smalltalk <CODE class="Smalltalk">ReadStream</CODE> and
<CODE class="Smalltalk">WriteStream</CODE> classes.  The emulation is patchy, especially for
read-streams (because Java's streams are not arbitrarily positionable).
</P>
<P>
These classes illustrate an important point &mdash; it is not necessary to follow the Java
class hierarchy slavishly when designing the hierarchy of wrapper classes.  In this case, for
instance, <CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaReadStream</CODE> captures commonality between the
Java classes, <CODE class="Java">java.io.OutputStream</CODE> and
<CODE class="Java">java.io.Writer</CODE> even though those two classes are not formally related
in Java.
</P>
<H2>Collection Wrappers</H3>
<P>
Java's new (well, it is fairly old now) Collections API is defined by a handful of
interfaces: <CODE class="Java">java.util.Set</CODE>, <CODE class="Java">java.util.List</CODE>,
<CODE class="Java">java.util.Map</CODE>, and so on.  Java does provide concrete implementations
of these interfaces, but there are lots of them, they are not all related in the hierarchy
in any useful way (there's no reason why they should be), and you are quite likely to come
across other objects that implement these interfaces, but which are not part of standard Java.
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the Java Collections are a good example of the need for
<A href="java-base.html#Interface Instances">interface instances</A>, JNIPort's built-in
facility for associating an adaptor with a Java interface.  (In point of fact, they were
the motivation for it.)
</P>
<P>
Given a Java object that implements the <CODE class="Java">java.util.Set</CODE> interface,
you can send <CODE class="Smalltalk">#asASet</CODE> to it (which is just an abbreviation for
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#asA: #'java.util.Set'</CODE>).  That will answer an instance of
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JavaUtilSet</CODE>, which understands the basics of the Smalltalk
<CODE class="Smalltalk">Set</CODE> protocols, as well as exposing the methods from the
<CODE class="Java">java.util.Set</CODE> interface in the
<A href="method-names.html">normal way</A>. You can further send that object
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#asCollection</CODE>, which will answer a deeper Adaptor
that is subclassed from <CODE class="Smalltalk">Set</CODE> and therefore understands
all of <CODE class="Smalltalk">Set's</CODE> interface (including whatever methods you
may have added yourself).  Similar observations apply to the other collections interfaces.
</P>
<H2>Iterator Wrappers</H2>
<P>
Java has two external iterator classes; the old <CODE class="Java">java.util.Enumeration</CODE>
and the newer <CODE class="Java">java.util.Iterator</CODE>.  Like the new collections, these
are best handled by JNIPort's interface instances. In this case the wrapper classes implement
the basics of Smalltalk's <CODE class="Smalltalk">ReadStream</CODE>.  A deeper Adaptor,
which is subclassed from <CODE class="Smalltalk">ReadStream</CODE>, can be obtained by sending
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#asReadStream</CODE>.
