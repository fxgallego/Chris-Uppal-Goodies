<H1>The JNIHelper DLL</H1>
<P>
JNIHelper is a C DLL, plus the Smalltalk code to use it.  It exists <EM>only</EM> because of the
mismatch between the Dolphin and JVM models of threads.
</P>
<P>
The JVM has three callback &ldquo;hooks&rdquo;; these are callback functions that JNI clients can
replace with their own functions.  The hook functions are called:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>When the JVM is about to exit.</LI>
<LI>When the JVM is about to abort (i.e. an abnormal exit).</LI>
<LI>
When the JVM has some debugging information to display (this would otherwise be
written to the console, but is not the same as the Java standard output streams).
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Dolphin's external interfacing is (with some extensions to handle <CODE class="C">varargs</CODE>
functions) capable of using these hook functions.  Unfortunately, because the JVM uses OS-level
threads (at least the Sun JVM does), which Dolphin can't handle directly, this is prone to
deadlock. See <A href="threading.html">the problem with threads</A> for the details.
</P>
<P>
The JNIHelper library provides a way around this.  It provides replacements for the JNI hooks
that can be called from any thread.  The way it works is (slightly simplified) that when the
replacement hook function is called, it stores the data provided with the call on an internal
queue, and then returns immediately to the caller.  A separate thread waits for data to appear
on the queue, and when it does, it calls back into Dolphin to allow JNIPort to consume the data.
Since the caller never waits for Dolphin, this should avoid the risk of deadlock.
</P>
<P>
An additional feature of JNI Helper is to allow the JVM's debugging stream to be redirected
to the Window's system debug stream, where it can be viewed with a tool like DebugView
from <A href="http://www.sysinternals.com/" target=_blank>http://www.sysinternals.com/</A>.
This should completely eliminate any possibility of the debugging output causing deadlocks.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to use JNIPort without the JNIHelper.  You can either just not use the hooks
at all (set from the <A href="setup.html">configuration</A>) which will side-step the problem
entirely, or you can accept a risk of deadlock.  Unless you are using more than one Java
thread then you will probably get away with it.  (But note that some Java features use
threads even if you haven't explicitly started any &mdash; AWT/Swing for one.)
</P>
<P>
The DolphinJNIHelper DLL, and the C source and a VC++ project file, are in the Extras\
folder which is part of the JNIPort download.  Put the DLL somewhere where Dolphin can find it.
Please note: I recommend that you rebuild the DLL from source if you can, or,
at minimum, run it through a reputable, and up to date, virus checker.
