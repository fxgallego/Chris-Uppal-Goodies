<H1>The Problems with Threads</H1>
<P>
This section is about the problems caused by the mismatch between the ways that the Java runtime
and Dolphin use and understand operating system threads.
</P>
<P>
The discussion may be quite off-putting, since it describes various ways of getting into trouble
without expecting to.  Of course, you can do that with any threaded code, but the Java/Dolphin
mix is particularly hard to get right.  There's nothing much more I can do to help with that; I've
tried to make this section as comprehensible as I can, but it's still not an easy read.  I offer
the following guideline:
</P>
<DL>
<DT>A Guideline:</DT>
<DD><P>
Mixing Java threads with Smalltalk <CODE class="Smalltalk">Processes</CODE> is risky or difficult.
Try to ensure that at any time <STRONG>either</STRONG> Java is quiescent, waiting to be invoked
from any Smalltalk <CODE class="Smalltalk">Processes</CODE>, but not itself running any active
threads <STRONG>or</STRONG> Smalltalk is quiescent, waiting to be invoked by
callbacks from any Java threads, but not doing any other work in background
<CODE class="Smalltalk">Processes</CODE>.
</P></DD>
</DL>

<HR>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
The Java runtime from Sun implements Java threads as Windows threads.  Other JVMs for Windows
either do the same, or multiplex several Java threads onto each OS thread (I believe that
both the IBM and BEA runtimes do this, or can be configured to do so).  In either case the
Java runtime is thread-intensive and is thread-aware.
</P>
<P>
Dolphin, on the other hand, executes all Smalltalk code in just one OS thread.  All the
Smalltalk <CODE class="Smalltalk">Processes</CODE> are executed by that thread.  Dolphin does
make some use of other OS threads, and is also thread-aware.
</P>
<P>
With a good deal of messing around, some determined turning of blind eyes to theoretical problems,
and quite a bit of care, it is possible to reconcile these two systems.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the problems revolve around callbacks from the Java runtime into Dolphin.  (The other
problems are described <A href="#Other Problems">below</A>.)  The Java runtime calls Dolphin code
in two ways: when a Java &ldquo;native method&rdquo; is implemented by Dolphin code, and when
the Java runtime's &ldquo;hook&rdquo; functions are implemented by Dolphin external callbacks.
Later sub-sections go into more details, but the problem, and the general strategy for
avoiding it, are the same in both cases.
</P>
<H3>The General Problem</H3>
<P>
The problem is that the callback into Dolphin can be made from an OS thread that is not the one
that Dolphin uses for running Smalltalk code (call it the <DFN>Smalltalk thread</DFN>).
In an ideal world Dolphin would be able to execute Smalltalk code on any OS thread, in which
case these issues would vanish, but this is not an ideal world.  Fortunately, Dolphin does have
a basic ability to handle such calls.  When the Dolphin VM finds that one of its
<CODE class="Smalltalk">ExternalCallbacks</CODE> is being invoked from a thread that is not
the Smalltalk thread, it blocks the caller, and passes the call to the Smalltalk thread for
execution, then passes back the answer (if any) back to the blocked thread, which is then
allowed to proceed.  The details of how it does that are not important (at least, I hope they
aren't, because I don't know them).  One detail is worth noting, though: the external callback
will be executed by the Dolphin &ldquo;main&rdquo; <CODE class="Smalltalk">Process</CODE>
(the one that runs the Windows event dispatch loop).
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately that can lead to deadlocks.  One way is because Dolphin cannot service
callbacks while the Smalltalk thread is executing Java code:

<P>
The threads are now deadlocked; each waiting for the other.
</P>
<P>
Another way to create a deadlock is if the a background thread takes out a lock, and
then invokes an <CODE class="Smalltalk">ExternalCallback</CODE> which indirectly
results in the Smalltalk thread trying to acquire the same lock.  For instance:

</TABLE>
<H3>The General &ldquo;Solution&rdquo;</H3>
<P>
The technique that JNIPort uses for dealing with these case is to decouple the two threads
wherever possible.  It requires a queue and an additional thread.  When the background thread
wants to issue a callback, it does not call into Dolphin directly.  Instead it places the
request onto a <DFN>queue</DFN>, and then immediately returns to its caller.
The additional thread, the <DFN>demon thread</DFN>, has been sleeping waiting for the queue
to become non-empty. When it wakes up, it sees the notification, removes it from the queue
and then calls back into Dolphin.  The demon thread will be blocked at this point, waiting
for Dolphin to finish handling the callback, but the original background thread has not
had to wait, and so the deadlocks are avoided.  Naturally, this technique can only be used
when the caller is not interested in the answer to the call.
</P>
<P>
There is an additional complication.  If the code in the Java runtime that issues the call
was running on the Smalltalk thread (because it had been invoked from Dolphin via JNI), then
it should issue the callback directly, rather than putting it on the queue.  For pure
notifications (where no answer is wanted) side-stepping the queue is just avoiding
a needless inefficiency.  However if an answer is needed, then the caller <EM>cannot</EM>
use the queue or else a different deadlock would occur, as follows:

<HR>
<H2>Hook functions</H2>
<P>
The Java runtime has three <DFN>hook functions</DFN>.  These are pointers to functions that
will be invoked by the runtime to allow client code to monitor the state of the JVM.  In particular
this is used for the runtime's debugging/logging output, such as the trace of loaded classes
produced if the <CODE>-verbose:class</CODE> flag is provided.  Dolphin's external callbacks
are capable (with a small extension provided by the 'CU Varargs' package) of acting as the
necessary hooks.  The problem is that the hook functions can be (and are) invoked from any OS
thread, so deadlocks are likely.
</P>
<P>
A particularly common way that the hook functions can cause deadlocks is through the
Java logging/tracing feature.  One example is Swing.  When Swing is starting up, as the
first window is displayed, Swing starts a new Java thread to handle user-interactions.
So, in the first call to display a window, something like
<CODE class="Smalltalk">aFrame pack_null; show_null.</CODE>, the call to
<CODE class="Smalltalk">#pack_null</CODE> calls Java code that starts the Swing thread and
waits for it to confirm that it is running (somehow).  If the new thread produced any logging
(as is likely if the <CODE>-verbose:class</CODE> or <CODE>-verbose:jni</CODE> flags are turned
on), then Dolphin/Java will deadlock. This is a special case of the first form of deadlock,
above.
</P>

<P>
The <A href="jni-helper.html">JNI Helper</A> library is an external DLL that provides wrapper
functions for external callbacks.  The wrapper functions use the queue/demon approach internally
to ensure that threads other than the Smalltalk thread are never blocked waiting for Dolphin to
handle the notification.
</P>
<P>
With the JNI Helper, as far as I know, all the deadlocks arising from logging are avoided.
</P>


<HR>
<H2>Native Methods, Notifications, and Requests</H2>
<P>
The other way that a Java runtime can invoke code in Dolphin is via Java's
&ldquo;native methods&rdquo;.  A native method is a Java method that is declared but not
defined in the Java code, instead an implementation is provided by external (to the JVM) code.
The implementation can be provided by using JNI to set a pointer to a handler function (it
can also be provided by a DLL but that is not relevant to JNIPort).
</P>
<P>
As in the case of hooks, Dolphin's external callback feature can be used to create
a &ldquo;function pointer&rdquo; that will actually cause Smalltalk code to be executed.
But, again, there is a risk of deadlocks.  JNIPort includes
a Java library that uses the queue/demon approach to avoid or reduce the risk.
</P>
<P>
In this case JNIPort can't <EM>eliminate</EM> the risk, since sometimes the caller does
need to wait for an answer.  For that reason Java callbacks are broken down into
Notifications and Requests.  Both go via the queue, but only the latter wait for
an answer.  See <A href="callbacks.html">Callbacks</A> for more information on how to use them.
</P>
<P>
There is an additional reason for using the queue/demon approach for Java callbacks.  It is
unrelated to deadlocks, but is caused by a quirk of the way that JNI works with threads.
</P>
<P>
All normal JNI operations are invoked via a pointer to a <CODE class="C">JNIEnv</CODE>
(which is a data structure rather like a COM object or a pointer to C++ object with a
vtable, the JNI API is mostly expressed as the &ldquo;methods&rdquo; of these objects).
Each OS-thread has its own JNIEnv, and it is not allowed to use that of any other thread.
In particular, all references to Java objects are via opaque &ldquo;pointers&rdquo; that
are only valid from one OS-thread; the references are &ldquo;local&rdquo; to the thread's
JNIEnv. (There is a way of getting a &ldquo;global&rdquo; reference that is valid across
threads, but that doesn't help with these problems.)
</P>
<P>
In fact, whenever the Java runtime calls a native method, it creates new JNIEnv that will
be valid only for the calling thread, and only until the callback returns.  (The main
point of this seems to be a half-baked attempt to make managing references to Java
objects from C code slightly automatic.)  That doesn't affect this discussion but does
cause an additional problem that is described <A href="#Finalisation">below</A>.
</P>
<P>
The problem is that it makes it impossible to pass references to Java objects from Java to
Smalltalk!
The reason is as follows.  Suppose that some Dolphin
<CODE class="Smalltalk">ExternalCallback</CODE> had been registered with JNI as the
implementation of a Java native method.  When the Java method is invoked, the
Java runtime will create a new JNIEnv for the thread where the caller is running,
and then pass it, a reference to the object who's method was called, and references
to any parameter objects, to the external callback.  Dolphin will ensure that the
external callback is actually executed on the Smalltalk thread.  But, unfortunately,
that isn't necessarily the same thread as the original caller.  If it is not, then
the provided JNIEnv is useless &mdash; it cannot be used from that thread.  Worse,
there is no way to use the references to the 'this' object and its parameters, since
those references are local to the calling thread/JNIEnv.  Which is limiting, to say the
least&hellip;
</P>
<P>
Fortunately a slight modification to the queue/demon approach provides a way around
the problem.
</P>
<P>
In JNIPort you are not encouraged to declare native methods and create your own
<CODE class="Smalltalk">ExternalCallbacks</CODE> to implement them.  Instead you
use a package of Java code that implements a queue of requests and notifications,
and a queue demon to look after it.  There is only one native method used by
JNIPort (it is actually
<CODE class="Java">org.metagnostic.jniport.DolphinNotifierThread.dolphinNotifierMethod()</CODE>;
which is static, returns <CODE class="Java">void</CODE> and takes no parameters),
it is used to tell the Dolphin that the queue of outstanding requests is not empty.
This one native method is implemented by an external callback in Dolphin.  That
(simplifying somewhat), goes into a loop, removing requests and notifications from the queue,
executing the appropriate handler code, and (for requests only) telling the request
object what the answer was.  The loop continues until the queue is empty.
Because Dolphin is calling &ldquo;down&rdquo; into
Java, it gets valid object references in the normal way, so the problem with passing
object references from Java to Smalltalk is circumvented.
</P>
<P>
The Notifications and Requests are Java objects that hold a reference to the originator
of the request, a parameter object (which, of course, may be an array), and a 
&ldquo;tag&rdquo; object that is used to identify the Smalltalk handler code.  The mapping
from tag object to handlers is held by the <DFN>callback registry</DFN> as
described in <A href="callbacks.html">Callbacks</A>.
</P>
<P>
The details of the interaction are quite complicated, and unfortunately have some
unintuitive consequences for the order of events.  To start with the simplest case,
here's what happens when Java code, that happens to be running on the Smalltalk
thread, sends a notification to Smalltalk:
</P>
<TABLE border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10>

<P>
The case where an answer is required is very similar.  The differences are only that the
Java code creates a Request object instead of a Notification; that the callback registry
records the answer from the handler in the request object; and that the Java code (presumably)
reads the answer and makes some use of it.
</P>

<P>
The next case is slightly more complicated.  If a notification is issued from a thread other than
the Smalltalk thread, then there are three threads that are actively involved, as follows:

<P>
One thing to note is that, for Notifications and Requests sent from the Smalltalk thread, the caller
does not return until <EM>all</EM> pending callbacks have been handled.  So, if there are
a number of background threads submitting callbacks at the same time, the original Java code
may be blocked until there happens to be a pause long enough for Dolphin to empty the queue.
</P>
<P>
Another thing to note is that this scheme does <EM>not</EM> protect against all deadlocks.
Notifications should be deadlock free, but if you are using Callbacks then you should ensure
that you do not hold any locks on Java objects while you are waiting for the response.
</P>
<P>
The last important point is that, as mentioned above, if the Smalltalk thread is not
executing Smalltalk, then it is not available to handle callbacks.
In particular code like the following can work unexpectedly:
</P>
<PRE><CODE class="Java">	void
	someMethod()
	{
		Thread[] workers = new Thread[10];

		// create some worker threads
		for (int i = 0; i < workers.length; i++)
			workers[i] = new Thread(...whatever...);

		// start them running
		for (int i = 0; i < workers.length; i++)
			workers[i].start();

		// wait for them all to finish
		for (int i = 0; i < workers.length; i++)
			workers[i].join();
	}
	</CODE></PRE>
<P>
If that method is called from Smalltalk, then it will block Smalltalk until it returns, so no
callbacks can be handled until it does.  If any of the worker threads issue Notifications,
then Dolphin will not see them until after all the threads have died.  If any of them makes
a callback Requests then it will deadlock &mdash; the thread will be waiting for Dolphin to
handle the callback, but the Smalltalk thread will still be blocked waiting for all the
threads to complete.

<P>
JNIPort releases references to Java objects by finalisation.  If you read the &ldquo;guideline&rdquo;
at the beginning of this section, then you may be struck by the thought that the Dolphin finaliser
Process will run even if the rest of Dolphin is passively handling callbacks from Java.  The
impression is correct, and the way that references to Java objects are cleared by finalisation
does break the guideline.
</P>
<P>
The problem is really more serious than just not adhering to an informal guideline. JNI specifies
that &ldquo;local&rdquo; JNI references must be released by the same JNIEnv as created them.
What's more, it insists (a severe and pointless restriction, in my view) that they cannot be
released at all if there's another JNIEnv active at the time for the running thread.  That means
that finalisation cannot feasibly be used to clear local references unless JNIPort as a whole
can be sure that only one JNIEnv is ever used.
<P>
That condition can be met only if no Java callbacks are ever used (the hook functions don't
cause a problem here).  That is the reason that there are two slightly different subclasses
of the Smalltalk class <CODE class="Smalltalk">JVM</CODE>.  One of these,
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JVMWithoutCallbacks</CODE> (a nice imaginative name) does not support
callbacks at all, and therefore can make use of local references.  The other,
<CODE class="Smalltalk">JVMWithCallbacks</CODE>, does support callbacks, but is therefore forced
to convert every local JNI reference to a global one as soon as it is created.
</P>


<HR>
<H2><A name="Other problems">Other Problems</A></H2>
<P>
Lastly, there are two race conditions that &mdash; as far as I can see
&mdash; cannot feasibly be removed.  In both cases there is a very small time period during
which, if the luck were against you, JNIPort would use the wrong JNIEnv for some operation.
</P>
<P>
It would probably be possible to remove the race conditions by adding yet more complexity,
and putting Semaphore protection around <EM>every</EM> access to the JNIEnv.  That would
cause a considerable increase in the already large overhead involved in using JNIPort.
Since I have not been able to produce any scenario where the problems manifest in practice,
I have not taken that step.  Possibly a future version of JNIPort will have a configurable
policy of some sort rather than hard-wiring the decision.
</P>
<P>
The first case applies during a callback.  As the callback is processed, i.e. when
the Dolphin VM invokes the <CODE class="Smalltalk">ExternalCallback</CODE>, JNIPort
switches to using the new JNIEnv that the Java runtime provides for use during the callback.
The problem is that at the very start and end of this period, before the new JNIEnv is
installed, and after it has been removed again, other Smalltalk
<CODE class="Smalltalk">Processes</CODE> could be scheduled to run.  If that happens,
<EM>and</EM> the other Process uses Java, then it will try to use the wrong JNIEnv.
One potential sufferer from this scenario is the finaliser.
</P>
<P>
The other case is about exception checking of JNI calls, it is applicable even
if callbacks are not enabled.  JNI uses a per-JNIEnv (and, therefore, thread-local)
flag to say 'an exception has been thrown from Java', and all JNI calls should check
the flag (all subsequent JNI calls will fail until it is cleared). Since all Dolphin
<CODE class="Smalltalk">Processes</CODE> run on the same OS thread, the possibility
exists that one Process could see an exception that had really been thrown from code
invoked via a JNI call from another Process.
