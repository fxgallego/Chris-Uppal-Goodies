<P>
Here is some of the free software I've written for Dolphin Smalltalk. I'm very slowly
working my way through the list of the things I want to clean up and publish; this is
what I've covered so far.
</P>
<P>
You may use this software only if you accept
<A href="TermsOfUse.html">these</A> conditions.
</P>

<P>
Everything here is built with Dolphin version 5.1.4 &mdash; which is the latest version
as I write (2004-05-03).  It has all been developed on my working mixture of Windows 2K
and XP, both with Internet Explorer 6, and that is the only environment where I've done
any testing. I dislike the &ldquo;new&rdquo; look of XP intensely so I never use it, and
don't test against it either.  Of course, I hope these goodies will work with other
combinations of system software &mdash; please let me know if you find any incompatibilities
(or other problems, come to that).
<P><strong>
Stop press (2005-12-09): Dolphin 6 has recently been released.  That breaks some of this
code (Ghoul and JNIPort are known not to work).  I will be updating everything for D6 in
due course &mdash; before Christmas, with luck.
</strong></P>
</P>
<P>
The most up-to-date version can be found (Gods of the Internet willing, and provided
that I've been paying my ISP bills) at my Dolphin Goodies
<A href="http://www.metagnostic.org/DolphinSmalltalk">page</A>.
</P>
<P>
A note about how I name versions. Each package has a version string of the form
<code>major.minor</code>; I increment the &ldquo;major&rdquo; number each time I
release a change (however small) that affects how the software works.  I increment
the &rdquo;minor&rdquo; version number whenever I commit <EM>any</EM> change to the
software (e.g. fixing a spelling error in a comment).  So, when I rebuild this site,
the minor version numbers of packages may change if I've made any such changes that
are too trivial to warrant making a new release and changelog entry.
