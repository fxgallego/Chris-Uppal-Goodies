FMB (the Filtering Method Browser) is a simple hack to provide a more flexible
kind of method browser.  In essence, it just shows a list of all the methods in the
system, reduced by applying one or more &ldquo;filters&rdquo; to select methods.  Since
the list of filters can be changed interactively, it provides a way of browsing for
methods using more sophisticated selection criteria than is easy to do with the standard
browsing tools.
</P>
<P>
The FMB is a normal method browser enhanced with a filter panel.  This panel
holds a list of filter objects that determine which of the methods are be displayed.
A picture will probably help show what I mean, so here is one:
</P>
<P>
<IMG src="FMB.gif" alt="Filtering Method Browser showing 10 methods">
</P>
<P>
In this case, the filters are set to show all the methods on Set that are in the
Dolphin package, but not in the virtual method category &ldquo;*-overriden&rdquo;
(that category is one of my extensions, you won't find it in the standard image,
but it is a category of all methods that are overriden in some subclass).  The
effect is to show that there are only 10 methods on Set that are not overriden.
</P>
<P>
By the way, I've scrunched everthing up in that example to make the picture smaller
&ndash; I normally use a much bigger window for the FMB.
</P>
<H3>Filters</H3>
<P>
The concept of the filters is actually slightly blurry &ndash; what the filter panel
holds is actually just a list of <em>Objects</em> and it's up to each object to decide
what methods are &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; to it.
</P>
<P>
You can add to the list of filters by using drag and drop from any of the system browsers
that support it.   You can also add objects to the list by using the filters menu &ndash; you
can add an arbitrary object by evaluating an expression, or there's a handfull of
prepackaged options that you can use.  I trust the menu is self-explanatory enough&hellip;
</P>
<P>

<P>
Objects indicate how they are relevant to methods by implementing the
<code>#isRelevantToMethodBlock</code> method, this is expected to answer a block (or other
&lt;monadicValuable&gt;) that takes a <code>CompiledMethod</code> as its single parameter
and answers <code>true</code> if the method is relevant to that object.  The FMB includes
a bunch of implementations of <code>#isRelevantToMethodBlock</code>, but of course you can
always extend or change them.  By default, the ways that
objects filter methods are (by class):
</P>
<DL>
<DT><code>Behavior</code> (i.e. <code>Class</code>)</DT>
<DD>
Selects methods that belong to that class or its metaclass.
</DD>
<DT><code>BlockClosure</code></DT>
<DD>
If the BlockClosure is monadic &ndash; takes a single parameter &ndash; then it will be
used directly as a filter.  That is, it will be evaluated for each method, and provided that
it answers <code>true</code>, then that method will have passed the filter.  If it is not
monadic, then the BlockClosure is treated just like any other Object (see below).
</DD>
<DT><code>CompiledMethod</code></DT>
<DD>
Selects all <em>implementations</em> of the same method, that is any methods that are all overrides
of the same root method.  (I'm a little unsure that this is the most convenient interpretation
to use.  I may change it in a later version)
</DD>
<DT><code>MethodCategory</code></DT>
<DD>
Selects all methods in that category.
</DD>
<DT><code>MethodProtocol</code></DT>
<DD>
Selects all methods in that protocol.  That is, methods with a selector that is in the protocol,
and which belong to a class conforming to the protocol.
</DD>
<DT><code>Object</code></DT>
<DD>
The default.  Selects methods that refer to that object (i.e. include it in their literals
lists).  This isn't wildly useful, it's just a handly fallback.
</DD>
<DT><code>Package</code></DT>
<DD>
Selects methods that are in that package.  This can be a bit slow, so it's generally
better to put Packages low down on the list of filters, so that they are applied to a
smaller set of methods.
</DD>
<DT><code>PackageFolder</code></DT>
<DD>
Selects methods that are in packages in or below that folder.  Even more than Package filters,
this can be slow.
</DD>
<DT><code>String</code></DT>
<DD>
Selects methods with that exact text (including case, unfortunately) somewhere in their source.
</DD>
<DT><code>Symbol</code></DT>
<DD>
Selects methods that refer to that Symbol.  This is slightly different from the default
(<code>Object</code>) case because special selectors like <code>#at:</code> are also handled
(albeit, scanning for special selectors is slow, since it involves decompiling the bytecodes,
rather than just looking at the methods' literals).
</DD>
</DL>
<H3>Filter Modes and &ldquo;All&rdquo; and &ldquo;Any&rdquo; Modes</H3>
<P>
The FMB uses <em>modes</em> (I'm afraid &ndash; I couldn't think of a way of providing the
power I needed without making the UI slightly modal).  The modes are controlled from the
filter menu, or from the toolbar:
</P>
<IMG src="FMB-detail.gif" alt="The modes toolbar of the FMB">
<P>
Each filter can be in one of three states: normal, inverted, or disabled (indicated by a green
tick, an inverted red tick, or a dash, respectively).  Inverting a filter changes its sense, so
that instead of selecting methods that are relevant to the object, it selects methods that are
<em>not</em> relevant.  Disabling a filter just turns it off temporarily without removing it
from the list.
</P>
<P>
There is also a global mode, the FMB operates either in &ldquo;All&rdquo; mode or in
&ldquo;Any&rdquo; mode.  In <dfn>All</dfn> mode, the FMB displays the methods that pass
<em>all</em> of the filters; in <dfn>Any</dfn> mode, it displays the methods that pass
<em>at least one</em> of the filters.  (The icons, by the way, are taken from the standard
logic symbols; logicians use an upside-down A, &ldquo;&forall;&rdquo;, to mean that all
objects have some propery, and a backwards E, &ldquo;&exist;&rdquo;, to mean that at least
one object has the property.)
</P>
<H3>Using it</H3>
<P>
Should be straightforward.  I hope.
</P>
<P>
It installs itself as an &ldquo;extra tool&rdquo; in the Dolphin system folder. You
can start it from there or from the Tools&rArr;Additional tools menu of any Dolphin
window.
</P>
<P>
When it comes up, it is in &ldquo;All&rdquo; mode, and there are no filters, so (since
every method in the system passes all of the filters) it shows a list of all the methods
there are.  You can add filters to the list by drag-and-drop, or by using the filter
menu.  Filters are initially disabled (for perfomance reasons; I may make this configurable
one day).  You can enable them using the filter menu, or the toolbar, or they cycle through
their three states if you double-click on them.
</P>
<P>
A word about performance.  Since the FMB is displaying a list filtered down from <em>all</em>
the methods in the system, there is obviously going to be scope for it to be slow.  On my
machine (a 650Mz P3) with some 37000 methods in the system, changing simple filters takes
less than a second, which I find reasonably acceptable.  It may not be OK at all on slower
machines (or for people with less patience than me).  Some filters are (as I mentioned
earlier) quite slow, so I advise putting them low on the list of filters, so that faster
filters will have reduced the number of methods they have to process.
</P>
<P>
The tool's a bit clunky in places, I admit, but I find it useful.  Please let me know if
you have any suggestions or problems.
